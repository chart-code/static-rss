You could take sleeping pills, but they've got side effects. Guidelines recommend you try Cognitive Behavioral Therapy For Insomnia (CBT-i), a medication-free process where you train yourself to fall asleep by altering your schedule and sleep conditions.</p><p>The journals are full of articles begging doctors to use CBT-i instead of potentially-dangerous sleeping pills. Doctors rarely comply: getting patients CBT-i is hard. The usual sound bite is that &#8220;there are 60 million people with insomnia in the US but only 75 licensed CBT-i therapists.&#8221; What can you do? Not much.</p><p>Until now! Late last year, Pear Therapeutics released a CBT-i app (formerly &#8220;SHUT-i&#8221;, now &#8220;<a href=\"https://peartherapeutics.com/products/somryst/\">Somryst</a>&#8221;) which holds the patient&#8217;s hand through the complicated CBT-i process. Studies show it works as well as a real therapist, which is very well indeed. There&#8217;s only one catch: you need a doctor&#8217;s prescription.</p><p>Wait, you can prescription-gate an app? Yes! Although you can download Somryst off your normal App Store, it won&#8217;t work until a doctor writes you a prescription to &#8220;activate&#8221; it. Until then, it just shows you ads for how great CBT-i would be if you could get it.</p><p>And it&#8217;s not just Somryst. I know of at least three other prescription apps. <a href=\"https://peartherapeutics.com/products/reset-reset-o/\">reSET and reSET-O</a> are 12-week courses to help addiction and opioid addiction, respectively. <a href=\"https://www.verywellmind.com/a-new-video-game-has-been-approved-by-the-fda-to-treat-adhd-5069615\">EndeavourRx</a> is a video game which is supposed to help manage ADHD in kids. I guarantee you there are a lot more of these in the pipeline.</p><p>In theory, an app is a great solution to accessibility issues. Some people can&#8217;t afford to see a professional. Or they have complicated schedules that make it hard to see a professional. Or they&#8217;ve been traumatized by the medical system and don&#8217;t want to see a professional. Or they have executive function problems and can&#8217;t schedule a appointment with a professional. Or they have bad insurance that doesn&#8217;t have many professionals in-network, and all of them have six month wait lists. Freddie de Boer, who has more resources and know-how than most people, describes his experience trying to get a therapist <a href=\"https://freddiedeboer.substack.com/p/addendum-why-didnt-she-just\">here</a>:</p><blockquote><p>I have had deeply imperfect access to mental health care over the  past two decades, given that this is the American medical system, but I  have had superior access to most people. And I still have consistently  struggled to get into therapy. I should have been in therapy constantly  given my mental illness and my biography. But I&#8217;ve barely been in it at  all. Consider immediately after my last hospitalization. I was highly  motivated to get a therapist; my life was a wreck, after all. I had time  away from work to look. And I had access to NYC union health insurance,  which is well-known to be strong despite years of erosion of benefits.  What&#8217;s more, New York has one of the <a href=\"https://www.downtownmagazinenyc.com/nyc-has-an-abundance-of-therapists-so-why-are-we-experiencing-an-increase-in-mental-illness/\">highest</a> therapist/analyst/mental health professional densities in the world. I  don&#8217;t have kids and my schedule was more flexible than that of most.</p><p> And yet trying to find a therapist was a <em>nightmare</em>.  A truly discouraging number of places didn&#8217;t take my insurance or take  insurance at all. Out of pocket costs that were cited were like $300 and  up. Tons and tons of promising-seeming options were not taking new  patients and several told me there were waiting lists. Also, many told  me that they were &#8220;not the right therapist to meet your needs&#8221; when I  told them about my bipolar disorder and recent psychotic episode. Two  more discouraging stories. First, I went to one place, had an intake  appointment, everything seemed fine, at the end the guy said &#8220;your  appointments will be Mondays at 2:00 PM.&#8221; I said, that doesn&#8217;t work for  me; back then I worked 8 to 4 PM, and it would be an hour commute on  either side, meaning I&#8217;d be leaving work at 1 PM every Monday and not  returning. I couldn&#8217;t imagine asking that of my boss. I&#8217;m sure I could  have forced them to let me for ADA compliance but I was already in a  very awkward situation given everything that had happened, and for the  record I liked that boss. So that was out. </p><p>The other one really  pissed me off. I had been having so many problems with insurance that I  made sure that the therapist I was going to see was in-network. I went,  had the intake appointment, it went great, she said they could be  flexible with my work schedule, and then she said &#8220;your therapist will  be Dr. X.&#8221; I was surprised. It turned out she just did that intake  appointment and would not be my full-time therapist. That was annoying  as I just shared a lot with her, but fine. I then found out that the  therapist she assigned me to <em>did not take my insurance</em>, despite  being part of the same group/place/whatever as the woman I had  researched. Let me remind you that an intake appointment typically  involves delving into some personal and traumatic background  information. That incident left me feeling completely powerless. </p><p>I  know people don&#8217;t mean to do harm but &#8220;why don&#8217;t you just get a new  therapist?&#8221; is a callous and unhelpful thing to say. It&#8217;s really fucking  hard even under good circumstances, that&#8217;s why.</p></blockquote><p>And when you do get a professional, half the time they  tell you that you just need to lose weight / quit marijuana / find Jesus / <a href=\"https://freddiedeboer.substack.com/p/letter-from-a-subscriber-my-new-therapist\">find wokeness</a>, and refuse to treat you until you qualify as virtuous enough to deserve their help. If they do want to provide treatment, there's a decent chance they'll demand a bunch of unnecessary tests and scans before they'll do the basic empirical treatment they should have started with. </p><p>I'm not some kind of anti-doctor extremist. I've been a doctor for ten years, my whole family is doctors, doctors are good people. It's just that one in every X of them is some kind of lizard-person infiltrator, charged with making getting health care as difficult and unpleasant as possible. I wish I could explain this better - I think a lot of healthy people who have never visited doctors are reading this and thinking \"Oh, come now, it can't really be that hard\", and your skepticism is understandable. It's only through working with thousands of psychiatric patients in every situation imaginable that I've started to understand exactly how much of a burden the requirement to see a doctor can be.</p><p>Therapy apps are a perfect solution to this problem. Except that if you make people go to a professional to get a prescription to use the app, you&#8217;re kind of clutching defeat from the jaws of victory.</p><p><strong>II.</strong></p><p>So why are health apps starting to become prescription-only?</p><p>Maybe you&#8217;ve read <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/06/15/fish-now-by-prescription/\">my old post on Lovaza</a>? Lovaza is prescription fish oil. You can get non-prescription fish oil from any supermarket or supplement store for $10 per Giant Jar. Or, if you prefer, you can go to a doctor and get prescribed Lovaza for $300 a month. Is there a difference between Lovaza and regular fish oil? Other than the 30x markup and prescription-gating, no. Nor is there much difference between regular methylfolate and prescription Deplin. You can get some effective treatment for very cheap as a supplement. Or you can get the same treatment for much more money as a prescription medication.</p><p>It&#8217;s hard and expensive to get a product into the official medical system. You need to produce studies for the FDA (it doesn&#8217;t matter if dozens of studies already show fish oil works, you need to do new studies) and prove you&#8217;re complying with various regulations. By the time you&#8217;ve done all those things, you&#8217;ve spent a lot of money. And also you have a sort of monopoly, in that you&#8217;re the only company whose fish oil is FDA approved and able to interface with organizations who will only work within the regular medical system (eg insurance). So you increase the price by 30x. Patients are fine with this, because their insurance foots the bill. Insurance companies are fine with this, because the law demands that they be fine with it. Even if you or I know that normal fish oil is just as good as Lovaza, the official medical system doesn&#8217;t know this, and the insurance company is not allowed to make use of this knowledge.</p><p>You or I could create a CBT-i app tomorrow and sell it for $1 or $10 or whatever the normal price of an app is. But it wouldn&#8217;t be official, and insurance companies wouldn&#8217;t pay for it. Pear Therapeutics created a CBT-i app, put in the work to make it official, and now they&#8217;re selling it for $899. &#8220;Our support team, PearConnect&#8482;, will help determine insurance coverage eligibility during onboarding&#8221;, says their website. </p><p>My guess is that prescription-gating is necessary because it&#8217;s the last step in the process of transforming it from an app ($10 price tag) to a &#8220;digital therapeutic&#8221; ($899 price tag). The magic words for forcing insurance companies to pay for something is &#8220;a doctor said it was medically necessary&#8221;. Make sure that every use of Somryst is associated with a doctor&#8217;s prescription, and that&#8217;s a whole new level of officialness and charge-insurance-companies-lots-of-money-ability.</p><p>The good news is, Somryst has partnered with telemedicine provider <a href=\"https://www.upscript.com/\">UpScript</a>. I know nothing about UpScript, but I suspect they are a rubber-stamping service. If you don&#8217;t have a doctor of your own, you can pay their fee, see a tele-doctor, and say &#8220;I would like a prescription for Somryst&#8221;. The tele-doctor asks if you have insomnia, you say yes/no/maybe/no hablo ingl&#233;s, and the tele-doctor hands you a Somryst prescription and charges you $45. </p><p>On the one hand, at least this saves you from Doctor Search Hell. On the other, it involves paying $45 for the right to pay $899. So it&#8217;s kind of a wash.</p><p><strong>III.</strong></p><p>Who killed the democratization of mental health?</p><p>A few years ago, I was so optimistic about therapy apps. I thought they would empower patients to take mental health care into their own hands, free from gatekeepers and big corporations.</p><p>But CBT-i is the killer app here, and people have spent the last few years bungling it. And now when something finally comes out that I can have confidence in, it&#8217;s designed to replicate all the worst features of the old system. Why?</p><p>I can&#8217;t really blame the FDA here. Their <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/media/80958/download\">regulatory guidelines for medical apps</a> are clear as mud, but I think they would let people make non-prescription CBT-i courses. You would have to replace claims about &#8220;treating insomnia&#8221; with weasel language like &#8220;supports healthy sleep&#8221;, but you could do it. As far as I can tell the FDA is doing the right thing - agreeing to certify apps that put in the extra work to go through their approval process, but not banning ones that don&#8217;t.</p><p>And I&#8217;m philosophically opposed to blaming Pear Therapeutics, the company behind Somryst. If you let a for-profit company charge $899 for an app, of course they&#8217;ll be all over that. I&#8217;m less interested in Somryst being greedy enough to charge $899 for an app - I assume most app makers would charge $899 if they thought they could get away with it - and more interested in why this is apparently a price that the market will bear.</p><p>I think I mostly blame the US health care system. Patients don&#8217;t pay for any of their own care, the government regulates insurance companies to the point of effectively deciding what they have to cover, and nobody is allowed to exercise common sense at any point. The system is set up so poorly that it incentivizes companies to prescription-gate their apps and charge $899 for them, and once you make that an option, of course somebody&#8217;s going to do it. This is part of why I am dedicating my life to building an alternative, non-insurance-based system of mental health care.</p><p>I secondarily blame all the people who should have made the $10 app but didn&#8217;t. There is just an appalling shortage of freely available CBT-i material right now. <a href=\"https://www.cbtforinsomnia.com/\">This person sells a $50 CBT-i course/workbook</a>, and I hear it&#8217;s pretty good. The Veterans Health Administration has some CBT-i apps, although I believe <a href=\"https://mobile.va.gov/app/cbt-i-coach\">one of them</a> is very limited, and <a href=\"https://mobile.va.gov/app/cbt-i-coach\">the other</a> is only designed to supplement a therapist rather than to replace them. None of these is exactly a CBT-i app, but they&#8217;re proof that you can do good work in this field, and potentially someone could tie it all together and make an affordable and accessible version of Somryst. I think this would be a worthy cause for any public-spirited entrepreneur. Maybe I&#8217;m wrong about the regulatory environment and you can&#8217;t actually do this legally, in which case you should do it anonymously and take payments with crypto. </p><p>And you should do it soon. Alexander Pope writes:</p><blockquote><p><em>Vice is a monster of such frightful mien<br>As to be hated, needs but to be seen.<br>But seen too oft, familiar with its face<br>We first endure, then pity, then embrace</em></p></blockquote><p>Any loss of freedom stings for a few months. Then it&#8217;s just The Way Things Have To Be. Oregon somehow ended up with a law banning self-serving gas stations. In 2018, someone tried to repeal the law and legalize them, and <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/01/11/self-serving-bias/\">was met with outrage</a>: what if there were gas-related injuries? What if people got confused and couldn&#8217;t fuel their cars? What if it increased inequality somehow? </p><p>Right now, in the heady youth of the industry, I feel angry about prescription-gated apps that cost $899. CBT-i is so good, and so important, and we were so<em> </em>close to being able to make it accessible to everyone. Then we snatched defeat from the jaws of victory. Getting your CBT-i will remain as financially and logistically inaccessible as everything else in medicine. Diphenhydramine, one of those <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/drugstore-sleep-aids-may-bring-more-risks-than-benefits\">risky</a>, tolerance-building sleeping pills we want patients to avoid, is sold over-the-counter at every drugstore for a few cents a pill. But if you want to learn how to get good sleep naturally with no side effects, you&#8217;re out of luck unless you have the resources and willpower to hunt down an in-network doctor and beg them for permission.</p><p>On the other hand, CBT-i is really good. Apparently nobody was incentivized to offer it electronically without this system. And this system ensures the electronic version will be high-quality and evidence-based. Insurance will pay the costs in some hard-to-follow way that will never make any individual person feel like they&#8217;re spending the extra money. I can already feel myself beginning to endure and pity and embrace this.</p><p>So do something with your anger while it&#8217;s hot. In a few years, $899 prescription-gated apps will seem good and normal. </p><p>(a few years after that, people will be outraged that some apps are still available without prescriptions. Isn&#8217;t that a public safety hazard?)</p>","enclosure":{"url":"https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/85301bcd-495f-4b60-b44e-f352d0f46515_2250x1500.webp","length":"0","type":"image/jpeg"},"dc:creator":"Scott Alexander","contentSnippet":"You can get GHB on the darknet for $20, but learning healthy sleep habits is $899 and by prescription only","guid":"https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/welcome-to-the-terrible-world-of","isoDate":"2021-05-12T23:23:36.000Z","itunes":{},"feedName":"astralcodexten","feedIndex":0,"href":"https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/welcome-to-the-terrible-world-of"},{"creator":"Scott Alexander","title":"Theses On The Current Moment","link":"https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/theses-on-the-current-moment","pubDate":"Wed, 12 May 2021 05:43:59 GMT","content:encoded":"<p><em>[followup to <a href=\"https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/the-rise-and-fall-of-online-culture\">The Rise And Fall Of Online Culture Wars</a>]</em></p><p><strong>1. The Salem Witch Hunts might not be the right metaphor</strong></p><p>We usually stick to the same stock examples of repression and retaliation against nonconformists - the Salem Witch Trials, the Red Scare, the Cultural Revolution. These are rightly remembered as awful, and reminders of them make good rallying cries.</p><p>But they were also <em>short</em> and <em>abnormal</em> - brief orgies of violence, after which people mostly regretted what they had done. They were bizarre unstable extremes in the history of authoritarianism.</p><p>If we zoom out a little, we find that most of human history involved enforced ideological conformity, censorship, and repression. Maybe the most available reference point for this sort of thing is the US in the 1950s. There were certain ideas everyone knew were off limits - atheism, communism, marijuana legalization, gay rights. If you supported those things, you might not go to jail, but you'd be excluded from most good careers and most of polite society. This system was very stable - everyone knew the limits, and people generally didn't push against them unless they really wanted to and knew what they were getting into.</p><p>This isn't to say the 1950s US was good! I think atheism, marijuana legalization, and gay rights were correct! It was an ethical disaster that their progress was held back for decades, and immensely unjust that the few people who spoke out for them got punished! My point is that the 1950s cultural regime was good at censoring things quietly and through general social pressure, with a minimum of Red Guards breaking people's kneecaps. This is good, insofar as getting your kneecaps broken sounds painful, but bad insofar as the repression was so subtle that it was hard to convince anyone that anything was wrong.</p><p>Instead of thinking of ourselves in the middle of a new Salem Witch Hunt, we should think of ourselves as just coming out of a rare period of unusually high freedom of thought - a weird 1990s moment that gave us South Park, the phrase \"if you don't like it then don't watch it\", and most of the early Internet. That period wasn't part of an inexorable trend toward rising freedom, it was a weird anomaly that has to be actively defended lest we sink back into the normal regime that typified the 1950s and pretty much every other time period ever.</p><p><strong>2. There's an oversupply of tweeting and an undersupply of everything else</strong></p><p>I don't want to say angry tweets never accomplish anything, but there is a massive oversupply of angry tweets compared to almost any other part of the machinery of change.</p><p>When I was writing the first draft of this essay, the big news story was the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone. I saw about 10,000,000 tweets dunking on it in one way or another, and zero trying to make a solid case against it that could convince an impartial observer. For example, if I remember correctly, there's actually a huge amount of formal academic evidence showing that policing decreases crime a lot, that decreasing policing increases crime, that the alternatives to policing that CHAZ etc propose don't work very well, that increasing crime hurts minorities the most, and that minorities are generally against this kind of thing. I'm not linking any of the evidence here because right now I'm going off scattered memories of having seen this kind of stuff. If someone were to write this all up into a 2000 word blog post \"Here's Why Defund The Police Probably Won't Work\" which is sober and friendly and decent enough to send to your leftist aunt, then you could send it to your leftist aunt and maybe convince her. Instead we have 10,000,000 people dunking on some stupid thing someone in CHAZ did which may or may not even turn out to be real, and zero people writing the blog post. The tweets preach to the choir and make angry people angrier; the blog post might make a real difference.</p><p>(I haven't written the blog post because I have only a limited amount of involvement in the culture wars before people write me off as a culture warrior and stop listening to me, and I try to ration this pretty heavily. But if I was going to get involved by making 100 tweets about it, I would decide not to make those 100 tweets, and write the blog post.)</p><p>I'm not saying you have to write blog posts! Get in a discussion with a real Defund The Police supporter you know and like, and see if one of you can change the other one's mind. Sign a petition or something. Campaign for a politician whose policies you agree with. Just do anything, anything at all, other than tweet.</p><p><strong>3. Crushing hope is actually bad</strong></p><p>Liberals lose the culture war if there's ever such a strong culture of fear that nobody is willing to assert any unpopular opinion, publish any heterodox research, or stand up for anybody who's gone against the mob.</p><p>Note the key words in that sentence: \"culture of fear\". Individual victories and defeats matter most when they're changing people's expectations about the future. If an innocent baker or high schooler gets destroyed quietly, that's a tragedy for the person involved but irrelevant to the broader conflict. The broader conflict gets fought entirely in the theater of how afraid people are.</p><p>So all else being equal, liberals' goal should be to prevent a culture of fear.</p><p>Partly this is an actual battle, one where we try to protect people and stand up against the forces of authoritarianism.</p><p>But partly it's a psychological battle. An attempt to keep morale high. When the authoritarians win, we need to be there reassuring people that the victory was a fluke, that academic freedom remains mostly intact, that there's still hope and space to fight back.</p><p>This isn't how I see real liberals behaving. The real liberals are shouting about how academic freedom is already dead, the Maoists are at the gates, you should be despairing and panicking a hundred times more today than you were yesterday.</p><p>I understand the impulse! There are so many people putting their heads in the sand that you feel like you've got to convey the magnitude of the threat. </p><p>But keep in mind that if you tell people \"the enemy is all-powerful and omnipresent and if you make the slightest effort to fight back he will destroy you\", most of them will answer \"wow, thanks for the tip, I'll make sure not to fight that guy\". If you're <em>too good</em> at conveying the magnitude of the threat, you risk doing authoritarians' work for them, creating exactly the culture of fear you hoped to prevent.</p><p>How does one balance these two considerations? I don't know, but usually if I feel like I'm not being truthful, I expect I'm doing something wrong.</p><p><strong>4. There are some surprisingly strong reasons for hope</strong></p><p>I partly made this case already in The Rise And Fall Of Online Culture Wars, but I think it's worth emphasizing here.</p><p>If cancel culture is the equivalent of the 1950s American consensus, we should remember the fact that that consensus eventually failed. You&#8217;re now allowed to promote gay rights, cite scientific research showing marijuana isn't a deadly poison, campaign as a socialist, et cetera.</p><p>I still don't have a great sense for how 1950s-era conformity and repression failed, but my best guess is something like a <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/02/04/respectability-cascades/\">respectability cascade</a> and the <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/04/22/right-is-the-new-left/\">barberpole model of fashion</a>. The most interesting intellectuals of the era became disillusioned with the consensus, a few halting and dangerous attempts to speak up produced common knowledge of this, and the new set of ideas spread outward. First a few mad geniuses, then the coolest artists and writers, then the brightest academics, then journalists, then well-educated people in general, then the population in general, and the last step was reaching the government (still not really complete; marijuana remains illegal at the federal level).</p><p>If we can draw some kind of general principle from that, then I like where this is going. Five or ten years ago, it felt like 5% of my social circle was openly concerned about social justice. Now it's more like 50% or 60%, including a lot of the brightest people who I respect most (I don't think this is because I've changed my social circle - it's stayed pretty constant over that period).</p><p>I admit that my social circle is tiny and highly atypical. It's just a bunch of weird Bay Area intellectuals and creative types who are really into sex and drugs. And they're up against the forces of an establishment so vast that it merges seamlessly into the very idea of American culture. Still, we had exactly that same fight in the 50s, and the weird Bay Area drug users won completely and overwhelmingly.</p><p><strong>5. \"Don't cancel people\" is not very well fleshed-out</strong></p><p>In some ways that's fine. The hippies didn't have many well-fleshed-out policy proposals either. \"Don't ostracize me for being gay\" is a perfectly fine thing to demand even if you don't have a beautiful crystalline philosophy telling everyone exactly what to do in every possible edge case.</p><p>Still, it might be worth having coherent principles, at least in order to assuage our own consciences. Are we actually committing to never exerting social pressure on anybody in any way? Like, what about boycott campaigns? It seems intuitively obvious that if Coca-Cola is using child slaves to pick cocoa beans or something, boycotting them until they stop is a perfectly acceptable and even commendable thing to do. And if it's okay to boycott them yourself, surely it's also okay to use social media as a platform to ask other people to join your boycott. But once you're using social media to arrange boycotts of companies you don't like, how is that not \"cancel culture\"? Is it just because child slavery is actually bad but the occasional offensive tweet isn't? A lot of people I know got really angry at Gawker when their CEO said that that bullying nerds was good and people should keep doing it until the nerds shut up and removed themselves from the discourse - were those people morally obligated to continue giving Gawker money anyway? Was <em>that</em> offensive tweet actually bad, but the one where somebody uses the n-word or something not so bad? Good thing everyone agrees on objective standards for badness!</p><p>(I&#8217;ve tried to start fleshing out my position <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/08/01/is-it-possible-to-have-coherent-principles-around-free-speech-norms/\">here</a>, but there&#8217;s still a lot of work to be done)</p><p>Or - some straw man libertarians have argued that the government shouldn't have banned discrimination against black people, because individual companies could choose whether or not to discriminate, and ones that didn't would succeed on the free market. Cancel culture itself has shown us how wrong that is - when the culture is pressuring companies to behave a certain way, they'll all cave in together, and nobody will dare try profiting off bucking the trend. Less straw-mannish libertarians (including myself) have occasionally made a weaker version of this argument, that if you've got a powerful enough voting bloc to make the government ban discrimination, you also probably have a powerful enough voting bloc that companies will pander to you without you doing that. Cancel culture has proven that one wrong too - a small minority of very dedicated people can impose a heckler's veto on the entire rest of the culture, and nobody else will stand up to them. But does this mean we <em>should</em> get the government to force companies to do things? Getting eg the government to eg ban colleges from having ideological litmus tests seems pretty violation-of-everything-we-believe-in-y. But what is the government's responsibility in breaking cultural strangleholds, and when is it appropriate to appeal to that? Again, it's a good thing we have objective standards for goodness, so we don't need to wrestle with these questions.</p><p>(I&#8217;ve tried to make a start on answering this question too, this time <a href=\"https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/more-antifragile-diversity-libertarianism\">here</a>)</p><p>Nobody will ever have a complete solution to these problems, and that's fine. It's like government authoritarianism. We all agree government authoritarianism is bad. But is banning guns the bad type of government authoritarianism? Nationalizing industries? Banning gender transition? Forcing everyone to wear a microchip so the police can track them at all times? There will always be debate about the exact limits of what's unacceptable, but our lack of coherent principles doesn't mean we're not allowed to object to specific acts of government authoritarianism in the meantime.</p><p>Still, if we're arguing against cancel culture, we're proposing that our current social norms should be replaced by different social norms, and it would help to have at least a vague sketch of what those norms are. This is another thing you can work on instead of tweeting.</p><p><strong>6. Somebody should explore the fall of Puritanism in Massachussetts</strong></p><p>Massachussetts in 1692 may have been one of the most repressive societies ever to exist. Anyone who spoke out against it was burned as a witch or exiled. Fine, okay, point taken, don't speak out against Puritanism. But by the 1820s, Massachussetts was one of the most <em>open</em> societies in the world. The Puritan Church <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitarian_Universalism#Puritan_roots_and_Congregationalist_background\">turned into the Unitarian Church</a> (I swear this is true, the Unitarian Universalists are the direct descendants of the 1600 Puritans). Intellectuals like Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau explored exciting new ideas like \"what if Christianity sucked and the real religion was my headcanon of Hinduism I made up after learning three Sanskrit words?\" How did this happen? I would love to read a book or a paper about it but I don't know of any.</p><p>And what about the Victorians in England? What about the gradual secularization of Ireland during the end of the 20th century? There are so many interesting stories of societies going from more to less repressive without obvious outside intervention. This is yet another thing someone should work on instead of tweeting! If we had a general theory for how repressive societies transitioned into open ones, we would have a better idea which levers to push.</p>","enclosure":{"url":"https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/41de84ca-d514-42f2-9c94-eeebe5a9686e_1440x907.jpeg","length":"0","type":"image/jpeg"},"dc:creator":"Scott

decade, but now the EU is going to change the rules. Will that actually matter, or is it just a $10bn wealth transfer to a few games companies? Link\nDoes Amazon know what it sells?\nAmazon has scaled indefinitely by treating every product as an interchangeable packet, and by not caring what they are, only what they weigh. At a fundamental level, it doesn’t know what it sells. What would happen if it could change that? Link\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                            \n                        \n                    \n\n\n                \n\n    \n        \n\n\n                        \n\n                            \nMY WORK / NEWS / IDEAS / OUTSIDE / DATA\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                            \n                        \n                    \n\n\n                \n\n    \n        \n\n\n                        \n\n                            \nTrump versus Facebook\nFacebook's independent oversight board had been asked to rule on FB's suspension of Trump earlier this year, and this week it kicked the question back to FB, saying that FB needs to present more systematic and coherent criteria (the 'Mark Says So' problem).\nFacebook, and to a lesser extent Twitter and Youtube, have reach and control over public speech that is quite different to newspapers or TV, yet when they make decisions around this they have neither the implicit legitimacy that comes from a social consensus around how newspapers or TV work, nor the explicit legitimacy of a state. And a 35-year-old product manager in Menlo Park doesn't want to decide the basis for political speech. Hence, 'let's have an external board of experts' - but if it's still Facebook's eternal board, what does external mean? Who decides? How does that intersect with the US constitution's bar on state control of speech? With the 90% of FB users outside the USA? With 'Section 230'? Everyone had their answer written before the result. Link\nApple versus Epic in court\nThe Apple/Epic App Store court case started this week. It mostly turns on legal arguments and court precedents around how to define the market, the platform and the payment system, not the facts or any 'smoking gun' emails, and a lot of US antitrust lawyers seem to think Epic's case is pretty weak (🤷🏻‍♂️). As I've written before, the EU has already effectively decided in favour of Spotify, so regardless of this case there are big changes coming. But either way, cases like this generally produce a lot of interesting disclosure:\nEpic produced lots of internal Apple emails showing how many scams and problems there are in store management, aiming to undermine Apple's 'we curate the store' argument. But these are mostly from 5-10 years ago (when it was having huge problems scaling) and could equally well show how necessary curation is\nApple produced Epic emails showing it planned the whole fight a year in advance and is investing massively in its own store\nFrom outside, the most interesting thing is the app store operating data: how Apple scans for malware and API abuse (no, the security is not all in the sandbox), how many apps are submitted and which ones are rejected. Also, there are only 17k Watch apps: like Amazon's Alexa, the Apple Watch is a huge success but has largely failed as an app platform.\nLinks: The court page, Apple metrics PDF\nWho owns a Marketplace customer? Questions for Amazon\n60% of Amazon ecommerce volume is buying from third parties through Marketplace - you're buying on Amazon but not from Amazon. So whose business is that? Who owns the customer in a platform business, and who is making the sale? (Epic might make the same point.) Three stories this week:\nApparently, some Amazon ecommerce people had access to data on third party Marketplace sales, which Amazon has always said should not happen. Amazon is both retailer and platform, and while it's normal for a retailer to compete with its suppliers (all retailers always have!) giving data on its Marketplace customers to its retail team is a conflict of interest.\nA court in a lawsuit over a defective hoverboard (remember those?) found that Amazon is liable for damage caused by defective Marketplace products. So who is really making the sale?\nSomeone found a database of companies and buyers participating in a large-scale project to sell fake Amazon reviews, and Amazon seems to have reacted by banning (temporarily?) some of the largest Chinese marketplace vendors (Aukey, Tomtop etc) - suddenly their pages are empty.\nLinks: data access, liability lawsuit, China paid reviews, Aukey\nYoutube versus Roku\nConnected, 'smart' TV has quietly taken a significant gatekeeping role in the TV business, with platform providers both getting into so-called 'addressable advertising' (see the IAB paper below) and starting to charge for placement (ITV in the UK recently complained that Amazon wanted them to bid against Netflix). Now Roku and Youtube are fighting, accusing each other of lying about the nature of the dispute, and trying to block each other. (Also, note how absent Apple is from these conversions - such strategic failure.) Link\nYahAol changes hands\nAs rumoured last week, a PE firm (Apollo) bought the vestiges of Yahoo and AOL from Verizon. These kinds of business have a very long half-life but zero chance of turning around - at some point in the future there'll be nothing left but a lawyer's office licensing out the brand name, like Polaroid or Pan-Am. Link, Microsoft's $45bn bid\nGoogle goes back to work, 30/20\nAs vaccines roll out, we're all wondering what a return to work really looks like. Google says three days in the office and two days out (for most people), and suggest that means it will need the same (or perhaps even more) square footage. If you're a restaurant next to the Google building in Manhattan, that might mean 40% less footfall. Link\nThe next Apple Watch adds glucose and blood alcohol?\nFrom the rumour mill: people have been trying to do needle-free glucose monitoring for ages, but Apple (and its suppliers) might have cracked it. More generally - Apple launched the watch with lots of ideas for what it might be (fashion? luxury? app platform?) but fitness and health is the one that's worked. Link\nAmazon's local network\nWith Apple's 'Find My' local wireless network now open to third parties, it's also worth looking at Amazon's equivalent, based on Alexa and Ring devices, which now has a partnership with Tile. Local mesh was always a fantasy as a competitor to cellular (very basic laws of physics barriers) but it's finally becoming interesting for very low power, low cost, low bandwidth applications - 'find my bag' is the first use case but there might be other, bigger ones. Link\nTwitter expands to paywalls\nTwitter's new 'hey, maybe we should execute!' strategy continues with the acquisition of Scroll, which makes a federated pay wall (pay one monthly subscription and your money is distributed to participating sites based on your readership). It can integrate this into the mobile in-app browser for a frictionless signup, and link to Twitter payment. It also launched a beta of tip jars and opened its clubhouse clone 'Spaces' to anyone with more than 600 followers.\nBut more generally - the growth of viable tools and consumer behaviours around paying for content, even if you're not a giant like the NY Times, and in parallel with the death of ad cookies, is one of the more interesting trends on the consumer internet right now. Link\nChip shortage is really hurting car companies\nThe global chip supply chain crunch has affected Apple and Samsung but the real impact remains in the car industry, where the lack of a few $10 chips for each car has halted entire production lines. Now car companies are stripping out features just to get production moving again. Link\nApple's targeted, tracked ad system\nWith iOS 14.5, Apple switched all 3rd party cross-app tracking to opt-in (ATT), and did the same to app install ads (IDFA), while leaving its own 1st party tracking switched on by default. Now it's adding its own app install ads to App Store search, and of course has its own team working on 'ad relevance' (AKA, well, tracking and targeting). Apple's PR around 'privacy' and 'tracking' has been as brilliant as its PR around in-app payment has been terrible. Links: Search ads, 'Ad relevance' jobs\nTesla legal: \"Ignore what Elon says about autonomy\"\nElon Musk has been claiming that Tesla will have 'Level 5' full autonomy working any day now for years, while never shipping anything close, and people working in autonomy have always rolled their eyes. Real L5 is 5-10 years away and has been for, well, 5-10 years. But now we see that Tesla itself acknowledged to the Californian government that Tesla actually only has Level 2 'assisted cruise control' working. 🤷🏻‍♂️ Link\nToday in cyber\nTwo big breaches this week: both a US hospital system and a gasoline pipeline that supplies 45% of the US east coast's needs were shut down by ransomware. This is all a very big deal, in slow motion. Hospital system, Pipeline\nUK spies block Chinese tech for 'smart cities'\nEqually, the UK intelligence services have blocked a number of local councils from buying and deploying 'smart city' systems from Chinese vendors. This is partly about straightforward espionage (though really, what can the MSS do with traffic cameras and parking tickets in Bournemouth?) but much more about control and the scope for disruption: do you want potentially critical infrastructure to depend on the goodwill of the Chinese state, given in recent years it's demonstrated quite what that 'goodwill' might look like? Link\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                            \n                        \n                    \n\n\n                \n\n    \n        \n\n\n                        \n\n                            \nMY WORK / NEWS / IDEAS / OUTSIDE / DATA\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n    \n        \n\n                        \n                            \n                        \n                    \n\n\n                \n\n    \n        \n\n\n                        \n\n                            \nIdeas from around the web\nPassionate opinion piece in the New York Times, from a member of the editorial board, calling for the government to ban 'dark patterns' such as, say, making it hard to unsubscribe.

Meanwhile, these are all also a swing of the cycle from bundling to unbundling - just as blogs unbundled media and then (mostly) got aggregated back up, now these companies let individual creators go direct, but this time get paid. \n\nPremium subscribers get the full column every week.

It starts with the Blake Bailey controversy, but goes on to explore what the surprising parallels between these two writers, who knew and respected each other, has to say about the left, Jewish identity politics, and American political culture today.</p>\n<blockquote><p>In 2014, the mystery writer Lisa Scottoline wrote an instructive <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/04/opinion/sunday/english-class-with-mr-roth.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">essay</a> for <em>The New York Times</em> about two undergraduate seminars she took with Philip Roth at the University of Pennsylvania in the 1970s. One of the courses was the literature of the Holocaust. Hannah Arendt was on the syllabus.</p>\n<p>In his five-page discussion of those years at Penn, Roth biographer Blake Bailey makes no mention of this course or Arendt. Instead, he focuses on the other course, “The Literature of Desire,” and Roth’s erotic presence inside and outside the classroom. In the wake of the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/21/books/philip-roth-blake-bailey.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">allegations</a> of sexual assault and inappropriate behavior that have been made against Bailey, the omission may seem small or slight. Yet it is telling. As Judith Shulevitz <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/blake-baileys-unforgivable-incuriosity/618723/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">argues</a> in a searching analysis of the allegations and the biography, Bailey is as incurious about Jewishness as he is about the reality of women. When the two come together in the form of Arendt, his interest seems, well, nonexistent.</p>\n<p>The result is a life stripped of one of its vital currents. Arendt was a real presence for Roth, and the unexpected convergence between their biographies and concerns, particularly regarding Jewish questions, is as uncanny as the doubles that populate Roth’s novels.</p>\n<p>The difference between the two writers is obvious. She was born in Germany in 1906; he was born in Newark in 1933. She fled Hitler and never looked back; he fled his parents and kept going home. She wrote <em>The Human Condition</em>; he wrote <em>Portnoy’s Complaint</em>.</p>\n<p>Yet, throughout the postwar Jewish ascendancy in America, as other writers and scholars eased their way into the conversation, Arendt and Roth distinguished themselves—not by stirring up the little magazines but by contending with the Jews. Summoning the anxious wrath of a still vulnerable community, Roth and Arendt occupied a singular position: defending the margin against the marginalized, refusing the political pull and moral exaction of an embattled minority. Today, at a moment of rising anti-Semitism and increasing polarization, when the tendency, even among writers and intellectuals, is to circle the wagons in defense of team and tribe, their shared archive of heresy among the heretics pays revisiting.</p></blockquote>\n<p>You can read on <a href=\"https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2021/05/12/arendt-roth-and-the-imperative-of-dissent/\">here</a>.</p>\n","dc:creator":"Corey Robin","comments":"https://crookedtimber.org/2021/05/12/double-trouble-the-identity-politics-of-philip-roth-and-hannah-arendt/#comments","contentSnippet":"Philip Roth has been in the news, as has Palestine.

That complicates things. As Francis Spufford described <em>Red Plenty</em> nine years ago in his own CT seminar:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nI was trying to stitch together a sort of story that paid more attention than usual to the economic motives for human behaviour, but even there, I wanted my account of causes to be as broad and open as possible, and not to collapse without residue into any single one of the rival diagrams of economic behaviour. Basically, I wanted to be awkward. I could take advantage of fiction’s built-in tolerance of overdetermination, in which multiple possible causes for an outcome can be allowed to exist alongside each other without being resolved, or even given definitive weights. Storytelling lets you bring negative capability into economics.</p></blockquote>\n<p>KSR was in that seminar too, arguing that <em>Red Plenty</em> was a novel. And so is TMFTF &#8211; it brings negative capability into the politics of climate change, allowing it to capture <em>both</em> how we need radical changes, <em>and</em> how we can’t be sure exactly which radical changes, in which combinations, we need. You can read the book as presenting KSR’s best guesses as to how such changes might unfold. But &#8211; and this is my argument &#8211; that’s not the only reading of the book. Because it’s a novel, it folds those best guesses together with the uncertainty that they will be right, and with the presupposition that actual history emerges, as the imagined history of the novel does, from disagreement and conflict between people with different guesses, different theories, different ideologies. From this perspective, the novel invites people who disagree with KSR’s surmises to advance their own, recreating in real life something like the arguments that drive the book.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-48744\"></span></p>\n<p>If <em>Red Plenty</em> addresses the present through a reconstructed past, TMFTF does it through an imagined future. It asks the reader to think about how we can get from here to there, but not by presenting a Single Great Plan That Will Resolve Everything If Only It Is Implemented Comprehensively. Instead, it depicts its better future as the result of a process of discovery, where none of the characters really understand the consequences of what they are doing at any point, but they still keep trying. Their various imperfect efforts (sometimes working against each other; sometimes reinforcing) plot a possible path out of the mess we are in, into a different and better mess than we could think that they (or we) might reasonably have hoped for. Some characters try to extend and change the international rule of law; others use organized violence; others engage in sporadic individual acts of terror and despair. Which is effective and which is necessary? It isn’t clear to us, or to the book’s characters (who change their minds as they go along), any more than we really know the paths to effective action are clear in the world we live in.</p>\n<p>Thus, on the one hand, TMFTF illustrates an imaginary path through which a better, imaginary future might be discovered. We don’t know whether there were better paths or better futures in this fictional microcosm, and never will. Novels are like real history, in that they never clarify the underlying causal forces (if they do, they stop being novels and start being social science). We don’t have access to a counterfactual novel in which the sons of Kali decided not to take up violence, any more than we have access to a counterfactual past in which Gandhi decided to take up the armed struggle against British imperialism. But not knowing isn’t an excuse for not acting (while TMFTF is not a policy tract, it is certainly a political novel).</p>\n<p>On the other, novels differ markedly from real history in that they are the product of the writer picking and choosing (perhaps consciously, perhaps as the result of some scarcely articulable habitus). A novel is a different kind of &#8221; imaginary relationship to a real situation,&#8221; as TMFTF describes the notion of ideology. It can help make sense of the blooming, buzzing confusion of the world (a phrase that KSR borrows from the pragmatist William James, and quotes at least twice in the book).</p>\n<p>A naive reading would suggest that TMFTF tries to represent the Sole True Ideology, even if not the One True Plan. I don’t think that is true, even if it likely represents KSR’s best guesses, his informed representation of how we might strike on a path out of our dilemmas. A different &#8211; and I think better &#8211; interpretation is that insofar as the novel has a political purpose, it is to get us to start people arguing about the right things, beginning to taking seriously the notion that we can escape from the political and economic trap we are in and figuring out what to do better, likely disagreeing much of the the time as the characters in the novel disagree, and sometimes working at odds with each other, but still moving half-crabwise towards a success that is cobbled out of failures. In other words, it is an invitation to get thinking, get arguing, get doing and get changing. And since I’m better at the arguing part than the doing or the changing, that’s what I’m going to do.</p>\n<p>KSR’s best guesses, as I read them, stem from a particular understanding of our current capitalist moment, and how it is likely to develop. His imagined world is one that is dominated by markets and technocracy.</p>\n<p>In this world, the Ministry For the Future, without ever quite planning it, becomes a kind of Modern Prince, seizing and repurposing technocratic and market means that it can turn to radical purposes. Social media platforms are the most visible expression of how global capitalism weaves itself into the lives of ordinary people &#8211; but they can be replaced by a new social network that displaces Facebook and its ilk. Global finance can be reconfigured by convincing the technocrats that run the central banks to change their policies. Blockchain can be weaponized to create new financial instruments that are centered on solving the problem of climate change. All this seems possible, because we live in a world where markets and technocracy have outpaced the global bourgeoisie that first set them in motion. Everything is decentralized, and the apparent elite is smaller and less powerful than it seems on its face. The chief servants of the order that they have created &#8211; the people who run the central banks &#8211; defect, because they are pragmatists, and figure out that they need to save the world to do their job. The result, as one character puts it towards the end of the book, is that the world is “saved by fucking bankers.” That’s not all that’s important in the narrative &#8211; technology, for example, plays a key role too. But it is a big part of what’s important.</p>\n<p>The reason I want to argue is that this isn’t the world that I see us living in right now (obviously, I could be completely wrong, and I’ve skin in the game as I and my co-author <a href=\"https://nationalinterest.org/feature/america%E2%80%99s-misuse-its-financial-infrastructure-52707\">have</a> <a href=\"https://direct.mit.edu/isec/article/44/1/42/12237/Weaponized-Interdependence-How-Global-Economic\">written</a> <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/07/04/this-is-what-the-future-of-globalization-will-look-like/\">a</a> <a href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2019-12-10/chained-globalization\">lot</a> about this, and we are writing more). As I see it, the standard technocracy-meets-Davos-meets-markets-that-no-one-is-in-control-of account of the world that both the left and the right believe is crumbling. Far from being decentralized, that falling world created the machineries of its own downfall &#8211; global networks that are being weaponized by states against each other. It is incredibly hard for newcomers to displace existing social media networks because of network externalities &#8211; the more people are in them, the stickier they become, because their value is a function of the number of users they connect. Global finance is becoming ever less technocratic, as states begin to take control, turning global financial networks into tools of coercion. Decentralized blockchains are less likely to succeed than central bank backed digital currencies, which have surveillance and state control built into their architectures. All of this centralization may itself be unsustainable &#8211; but the future that it will give way to is less likely a new decentralized global architecture that citizens can control for global benefit, than a fragmented world in which national states reassert their domestic power while looking as best they can to impose it on others.</p>\n<p>This implies a different analysis of the relationship between empire and technocracy than KSR’s. TMFTF identifies US power as the source and for a long time, the mainstay of the “soft power imperialism and economic dominance” that created the globalized world that we live in. The US was the main author of the IMF, of structural adjustment, and the panoply of purportedly technocratic institutions that helped sustain a world where the US had all the assets. But after US power, the technocrats can escape the logic of empire. They are pragmatists, and can be persuaded that the best way to do their jobs is to save everyone. The world of great power domination described at the beginning of the book, where “the US does what it wants,” regardless of international law, gradually turns into one where Ministry officials don’t need even to pretend to take the US and other great power wannabes seriously.</p>\n<p>The near future that I see, in contrast, is one where US soft power imperialism continues to be strong &#8211; and where the most plausible threats to it come from other states aspiring to the throne. We are living in a world in which the old logic of geopolitics is returning, albeit in very complicated ways. Quinn Slobodian’s history, The Globalists, depicts neo-liberalism as a political project aimed at hemming in imperium (the ability of nation-states to assert authority), via an extension of dominium (international flows of money and of commodities). Now, we are seeing imperium reasserting itself &#8211; but in a world that has been remade by dominium, creating new opportunities and new vulnerabilities. Nation states are re-asserting themselves in a world of flows and hidden ties and intimacies. This suggests a different trajectory than TMFTF’s.</p>\n<p>Put differently, the moment when it was easiest for international organizations, cross-national movements of people, and temporary cross-national alliances of civil society to have influence was the moment where globalization was at its peak, so that different countries’ economies commingled, generating both pressures for change, and opportunities for people and organizations to work across different jurisdictions to generate that change. That peak may be past. If &#8211; as seems likely &#8211; we are descending into an era of decoupling, and increased national control of the economy, those opportunities will dwindle. International organizations will be weaker. Increased suspicion and dwindling linkages mean that it will be harder for non-state actors to work together across national borders. Global networks will become more contested internationally, and more entrenched (thanks to growing links with the state) in their home jurisdictions.</p>\n<p>This is a more pessimistic understanding of world affairs than TMFTF’s. But there are still opportunities for change. It isn’t only central bankers who can be pragmatic &#8211; indeed, they are often more ideological and less pragmatic than TMFTF suggests. Empire has been willing to commingle pragmatism and ruthlessness where necessary, including the US imperium. At one point, TMFTF describes a future Head of the Federal Reserve as refusing to consider the possibility that it might support another currency.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nI don’t see how we can get into the business of backing a currency that isn’t the US dollar,” she said when Mary was done. “The Federal Reserve exists to protect and stabilize the dollar, nothing else. That means stabilizing prices more generally, which means we pay attention to unemployment levels too, and try to help there as we can. So this idea is not really in our purview, and if we tried this new alternative currency and it somehow destabilized or harmed the status of the dollar, we would be worse than derelict in our duty.”\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>But as Adam Tooze’s history of the 2008-2009 crisis emphasizes, the Fed is very definitely and self-consciously <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/301357/crashed-by-adam-tooze/\">in the business</a> of backing other currencies when necessary. Back then, it <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2020/04/21/839374663/why-is-the-fed-sending-billions-of-dollars-all-over-the-world\">feared</a> that if it didn’t provide massive swap lines and repo facilities to other central banks, the world economy would crash. It furthermore knew that precisely because of dollar sovereignty, it was the only actor that could do this at sufficient scale. In contrast, it was the technocrats of the European Union who were unwilling to provide large scale help to their own member states when their debt became unsustainable, without attaching swingeing conditions that even the IMF quailed at.</p>\n<p>I don’t want for a moment to provide a general defense of empire, the cruelties of which abound. But if my alternative understanding of the likely near future is right (a big if), the political possibilities of dealing with climate change are going to have to run through empire, whether the US empire of global finance, China’s efforts to create an alternative, or the more subtle imperium of the European Union’s acquis and regulatory influence. The implication is then that we are mostly only going to see political action against climate change when empire is sufficiently cognizant of its self-interest to solve broader problems, and global cooperation when different empires are willing to set aside their differences to work together. “Mostly” is key here &#8211; no political logic explains everything, and there is always a gap between ideology and reality. There will still be tacit interconnections, technologies moving across borders, trade and investment (if truncated to some greater or lesser degree by security fears).</p>\n<p>In this world, other possibilities might open up. Under the Biden administration, the US is changing how it thinks about the world in ways that I at least didn’t expect. For example &#8211; who would have predicted that the US would press for a minimum global tax rate for business, looking to limit its ability to relocate to minimize its tax burden, and threaten countries that taxed it too heavily? That doesn’t do much that directly addresses climate change &#8211; but it offers a model for how a powerful state can press for global regulatory changes. The US exercises extraordinary power through its control of the global financial system (exercised through its power to regulate the dollar clearing system, and influence SWIFT, the global financial messaging system). Nicholas Mulder has written <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/sanctions-economy-foreign-policy/\">powerfully</a> about the destructive consequences of sanctions. Yet he also muses about how a left-leaning foreign policy might direct sanctions against tax evasion and global financial oligarchy, and elsewhere <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/climate-green-new-deal/\">argues</a> that “Green New Dealers should consider recasting the tools of US hegemony, beginning with carbon tariffs and corporate sanctions,” as a complement to a Green lend-lease program of international technology transfer. Todd Tucker, who contributes elsewhere to this seminar, <a href=\"https://rooseveltinstitute.org/publications/green-new-deal-ten-year-window-to-reshape-international-economic-law/\">argues</a> for a new left internationalist program, where the US would look to reshape international law so that it supported rather than hindered domestic efforts to address climate change. These might be reinforced by, or reinforce European efforts to impose carbon border taxes.</p>\n<p>The limits to these possibilities are just as clear. They will only work so long as empires have some self-interested reasons to implement them, and actions which cut against this self interest will not succeed, even if they are necessary. They will be compromised by the internal politics of empire &#8211; the gross inequalities that it involves and the desire to maintain them. They will be complicated &#8211; at the very best &#8211; by the politics of clashes among emerging empires and with aspiring ones. And they will be entirely insufficient. Real action will both have to engage with the realities of the world we live in, and the commitment to something that is radically better. The argument over American empire between <a href=\"https://newleftreview.org/issues/ii119/articles/perry-anderson-situationism-a-l-envers\">Perry Anderson</a> and Adam Tooze (whose <a href=\"https://adamtooze.com/2019/10/12/response-to-anderson-preface-thanks/\">response</a> is yet to come out; presumably delayed by the events of the last year) is one manifestation of these tensions. But if we are not living in a world of self-organizing and decentralized global markets, and instead are being propelled along a trajectory to new kinds of imperium, these are the tensions and the contradictions that we are going to have to live with. I don’t know what a TMFTF written in this world would look like, but TMFTF has been one of the main spurs to the broader argument of a book that Abraham Newman and I are now writing. And if other better thinkers have been spurred as well, then TMFTF will have done important work.</p>\n","dc:creator":"Henry","comments":"https://crookedtimber.org/2021/05/12/technocracy-and-empire/#respond","contentSnippet":"The Ministry for the Future is a novel, not a manifesto.

I live in the present, and spend most of my waking hours analysing the economy and society of today, along with the recent past and near future. In doing that, I am, for the most part, in agreement with Mr Gradgrind &#8211; what I want is facts, nothing but facts.</p>\n<p>But in relation to the future (and, in many ways, the past) we don’t have facts, only possibilities. And, unlike the present, we don’t have lived experience to help us understand those possibilities. Speculative fiction, at its best, extends our thinking to encompass possibilities we wouldn’t otherwise consider, and to imagine ways of life no one has actually experienced.<span id=\"more-48702\"></span></p>\n<p>Thought of this way, The Ministry for the Future is like an all-you-can-eat buffet with more possibilities, both dystopian and utopian than it’s possible to digest in one sitting. I’m just going to pick out one morsel &#8211; the idea of returning half the earth to a more or less wild state. The Half Earth idea isn’t Robinson’s invention &#8211; there’s an active society promoting it. But Robinson’s presentation makes it seem more real than an advocacy organization.</p>\n<p>Once I’m captured by an idea like this, I tend to go back the analytical mode, and ask whether this is really a possibility. The first thought that occurred to me is was a memory from high school,. One of my friends was a keen conservationists (he was later responsible for management of environmental water allocations in Australia) who pushed the  idea that 5 per cent of Australia’s land area should be national park.</p>\n<p>That proposal seemed radical at the time, but we now have a ‘National Reserve System’ covering nearly 20 per cent of the country. It encompasses national, state and territory reserves, indigenous lands and protected areas run by non-profit conservation organisations and ecosystems protected by farmers on their private working properties. That National Reserve System is still growing, with a particular emphasis on the wildlife corridors central to Half Earth.</p>\n<p>Australia is a big, sparsely populated country, much of which isn’t particularly well suited for any economic use, including food production. We can grow enough to feed ourselves, export lots of grain and meat, and still have plenty of land left over. But is it possible to feed, clothe and house the whole world using only half its land and oceans?</p>\n<p>In large part that depends on how many people there are in the future. That in turn depends almost entirely on what happens to birth rates in Africa, since most of the world is already near, or below, replacement levels of fertility. In Robinson’s Future, net births per woman fall rapidly to around 1.8, so population is already declining in the second half of the 20th century. That’s partly optimism and partly a predictable outcome of the climatic disasters that destroy much of our existing social order in the opening chapters of the book.</p>\n<p>I’m an agricultural economist by training, so I’ve spent a fair bit of time looking at food production. We are already producing more than enough to feed the entire population of the world. 800 million people are undernourished simply because they don’t have enough money to buy food; they are outnumbered three to one by the obese, many of whom also lack the resources and education needed for a healthier diet.</p>\n<p>It will however, be difficult to feed a growing population if everyone is to eat the amounts of meat and fish typical of the diets of high-income countries. Conversely, if we are to return lots of land to a wild state, everyone will have to eat a largely plant-based diet. Whether meat animals are fed on grain or on grass, it takes a lot more land to produce animal protein than to do produce the same quantity of plant-based food.</p>\n<p>As well as farmland, we would need to reduce the area of land we live on, moving from small towns and suburbs into cities.  The scene in Future where the residents of a declining country town agree to sell en masse and move to the city makes this seem like a realistic, if emotionally challenging, possibility.   But as the narrator says, with a much smaller population, it might be possible to move back to village life further in the future.</p>\n<p>We are, suddenly and surprisingly, at a point in history when radical change seems not just possible but likely. Whether it is change for the better or for the worse is in our collective hands. The Ministry for the Future gives us hope that, out of disaster, we may build something much better.</p>\n","dc:creator":"John Quiggin","comments":"https://crookedtimber.org/2021/05/11/half-the-earth/#comments","contentSnippet":"When I read fiction, it’s mostly either the 19th century classics or speculative fiction – what was and what might be, as opposed to what is.

However, how further transformers can go - are they ready to take some more notoriously difficult vision tasks, e.g., generative adversarial networks (GANs)? Driven by that curiosity, we conduct the first pilot study in building a GAN, using only pure transformer-based architectures. Our vanilla GAN architecture, dubbed TransGAN, consists of a memory-friendly transformer-based generator that progressively increases feature resolution while decreasing embedding dimension, and a patch-level discriminator that is also transformer-based. We then demonstrate TransGAN to notably benefit from data augmentations (more than standard GANs), a multi-task co-training strategy for the generator, and a locally initialized self-attention that emphasizes the neighborhood smoothness of natural images. Equipped with those findings, TransGAN can effectively scale up with bigger models and high-resolution image datasets. Specifically, our best architecture achieves highly competitive performance compared to current state-of-the-art GANs based on convolutional backbones. Specifically, TransGAN sets new state-of-the-art IS score of 10.10 and FID score of 25.32 on STL-10. It also reaches competitive 8.64 IS score and 11.89 FID score on Cifar-10, and 12.23 FID score on CelebA 64&#215;64, respectively. We also conclude with a discussion of the current limitations and future potential of TransGAN.</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10350\">Carbon Emissions and Large Neural Network Training</a></strong></p><p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p><p>The computation demand for machine learning (ML) has grown rapidly recently, which comes with a number of costs. Estimating the energy cost helps measure its environmental impact and finding greener strategies, yet it is challenging without detailed information. We calculate the energy use and carbon footprint of several recent large models-T5, Meena, GShard, Switch Transformer, and GPT-3-and refine earlier estimates for the neural architecture search that found Evolved Transformer. We highlight the following opportunities to improve energy efficiency and CO2 equivalent emissions (CO2e): Large but sparsely activated DNNs can consume &lt;1/10th the energy of large, dense DNNs without sacrificing accuracy despite using as many or even more parameters. Geographic location matters for ML workload scheduling since the fraction of carbon-free energy and resulting CO2e vary ~5X-10X, even within the same country and the same organization. We are now optimizing where and when large models are trained. Specific datacenter infrastructure matters, as Cloud datacenters can be ~1.4-2X more energy efficient than typical datacenters, and the ML-oriented accelerators inside them can be ~2-5X more effective than off-the-shelf systems. Remarkably, the choice of DNN, datacenter, and processor can reduce the carbon footprint up to ~100-1000X. These large factors also make retroactive estimates of energy cost difficult. To avoid miscalculations, we believe ML papers requiring large computational resources should make energy consumption and CO2e explicit when practical. We are working to be more transparent about energy use and CO2e in our future research. To help reduce the carbon footprint of ML, we believe energy usage and CO2e should be a key metric in evaluating models, and we are collaborating with MLPerf developers to include energy usage during training and inference in this industry standard benchmark.</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01601\">MLP-Mixer: An all-MLP Architecture for Vision</a></strong></p><p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p><p>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are the go-to model for computer vision. Recently, attention-based networks, such as the Vision Transformer, have also become popular. In this paper we show that while convolutions and attention are both sufficient for good performance, neither of them are necessary. We present MLP-Mixer, an architecture based exclusively on multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). MLP-Mixer contains two types of layers: one with MLPs applied independently to image patches (i.e. \"mixing\" the per-location features), and one with MLPs applied across patches (i.e. \"mixing\" spatial information). When trained on large datasets, or with modern regularization schemes, MLP-Mixer attains competitive scores on image classification benchmarks, with pre-training and inference cost comparable to state-of-the-art models. We hope that these results spark further research beyond the realms of well established CNNs and Transformers.</p>","enclosure":{"url":"https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9d25eb61-b51f-4a21-a4c2-42e800e1d6c4_420x300.png","length":"0","type":"image/jpeg"},"dc:creator":"Gr&#233;goire Jauvion","contentSnippet":"PyTorchVideo, sports analytics with deep learning, the Atlas of AI book, GPU shortage, carbon emissions of large neural networks, and more","guid":"https://www.deeplearningweekly.com/p/deep-learning-weekly-issue-197","isoDate":"2021-05-12T14:05:54.000Z","itunes":{},"feedName":"deeplearningweekly","feedIndex":0,"href":"https://www.deeplearningweekly.com/p/deep-learning-weekly-issue-197"},{"title":"listen, are we CERTAIN it doesn't mean \"gluten-free\"","link":"http://www.qwantz.com/index.php?comic=3744","pubDate":"Wed, 12 May 2021 00:00:00 -0700","content":"<center><table width=740 border=0 cellspacing=5 cellpadding=5><tr><td colspan=4 align=\"center\"><tr><td colspan=4 align=\"center\"><a href=\"http://www.qwantz.com/archive.php\">archive</a> - <a href=\"mailto:ryan@qwantz.com?subject=man%20if%20it%20turns%20out%20to%20mean%20&quot;metaphorical&quot;%20i'm%20gonna%20be%20so%20cheesed\">contact</a> - <a href=\"http://www.topatoco.com/qwantz\">sexy exciting merchandise</a> - <a href=\"http://www.ohnorobot.com/index.php?comic=23\">search</a> - <a href=\"http://www.qwantz.com/about.php\">about</a></td></tr></table><img src=\"http://www.qwantz.com/comics/comic2-3945.png\" class=\"comic\" title=\"YOU HAVE DISCOVERED MY SECRET LOOPHOLE HIDDEN IN THE ANCIENT TEXTS FOR MILLENNIA / DON'T TELL NICOLAS CAGE\"><table width=740 border=0 cellspacing=5 cellpadding=5><tr><td width=100 align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"><a rel=\"prev\" href=\"http://www.qwantz.com/index.php?comic=3743\">&larr;

For example, a good vision-language matching model can help users find the most relevant images given a text description or an image input and help tools such as Google <a href=\"https://lens.google.com/\">Lens</a> find more fine-grained information about an image.  </p><p>To learn such representations, current state-of-the-art (SotA) visual and vision-language models rely heavily on curated training datasets that require expert knowledge and extensive labels. For vision applications, representations are mostly learned on large-scale datasets with explicit class labels, such as <a href=\"https://www.image-net.org/\">ImageNet</a>, <a href=\"https://opensource.google/projects/open-images-dataset\">OpenImages</a>, and <a href=\"https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/jft-300m\">JFT-300M</a>. For vision-language applications, popular pre-training datasets, such as <a href=\"https://ai.google.com/research/ConceptualCaptions\">Conceptual Captions</a> and <a href=\"https://visualgenome.org/\">Visual Genome Dense Captions</a>, all require non-trivial data collection and cleaning steps, limiting the size of datasets and thus hindering the scale of the trained models. In contrast, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing\">natural language processing</a> (NLP) models have achieved SotA performance on <a href=\"https://gluebenchmark.com/\">GLUE</a> and <a href=\"https://super.gluebenchmark.com/\">SuperGLUE</a> benchmarks by utilizing large-scale pre-training on raw text <em>without</em> human labels. </p><p>In \"<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05918\">Scaling Up Visual and Vision-Language Representation Learning With Noisy Text Supervision</a>\", to appear at <a href=\"https://icml.cc/Conferences/2021\">ICML 2021</a>, we propose bridging this gap with publicly available image alt-text data (written copy that appears in place of an image on a webpage if the image fails to load on a user's screen) in order to train larger, state-of-the-art vision and vision-language models. To that end, we leverage a noisy dataset of over one billion image and alt-text pairs, obtained without expensive filtering or post-processing steps in the <a href=\"https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/09/conceptual-captions-new-dataset-and.html\">Conceptual Captions</a> dataset. We show that the scale of our corpus can make up for noisy data and leads to SotA representation, and achieves strong performance when transferred to classification tasks such as ImageNet and <a href=\"https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/11/the-visual-task-adaptation-benchmark.html\">VTAB</a>. The aligned visual and language representations also set new SotA results on <a href=\"http://bryanplummer.com/Flickr30kEntities/\">Flickr30K</a> and <a href=\"https://cocodataset.org/#home\">MS-COCO</a> benchmarks, even when compared with more sophisticated cross-attention models, and enable zero-shot image classification and cross-modality search with complex text and text + image queries. </p><p><b>Creating the Dataset</b><br />Alt-texts <em>usually</em> provide a description of what the image is about, but the dataset is “noisy” because some text may be partly or wholly unrelated to its paired image. </p> <table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-95CxjbAC6nM/YJqTiXqr7AI/AAAAAAAAHlg/iG3kb9mxck8o86epEJHkUF7V9v5sc3SdgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1023/image5.png\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"535\" data-original-width=\"1023\" height=\"334\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-95CxjbAC6nM/YJqTiXqr7AI/AAAAAAAAHlg/iG3kb9mxck8o86epEJHkUF7V9v5sc3SdgCLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h334/image5.png\" width=\"640\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Example image-text pairs randomly sampled from the training dataset of ALIGN. One clearly noisy text label is marked in italics. </td></tr></tbody></table>    <p>In this work, we follow the methodology of constructing the Conceptual Captions dataset  to get a version of raw English alt-text data (image and alt-text pairs). While the Conceptual Captions dataset was cleaned by heavy filtering and post-processing, this work scales up visual and vision-language representation learning by relaxing most of the cleaning steps in the original work. Instead, we only apply minimal frequency-based filtering. The result is a much larger but noisier dataset of 1.8B image-text pairs. </p><p><b>ALIGN: A Large-scale ImaGe and Noisy-Text Embedding</b><br />For the purpose of building larger and more powerful models easily, we employ a simple dual-encoder architecture that learns to align visual and language representations of the image and text pairs. Image and text encoders are learned via a <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/contrastive-loss-explaned-159f2d4a87ec\">contrastive loss (formulated as normalized softmax)</a> that pushes the embeddings of matched image-text pairs together while pushing those of non-matched image-text pairs (within the same batch) apart. The large-scale dataset makes it possible for us to scale up the model size to be as large as <a href=\"https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/05/efficientnet-improving-accuracy-and.html\">EfficientNet-L2</a> (image encoder) and <a href=\"https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/11/open-sourcing-bert-state-of-art-pre.html\">BERT-large</a> (text encoder) trained from scratch.

For example, a good vision-language matching model can help users find the most relevant images given a text description or an image input and help tools such as Google Lens find more fine-grained information about an image.  \nTo learn such representations, current state-of-the-art (SotA) visual and vision-language models rely heavily on curated training datasets that require expert knowledge and extensive labels. For vision applications, representations are mostly learned on large-scale datasets with explicit class labels, such as ImageNet, OpenImages, and JFT-300M. For vision-language applications, popular pre-training datasets, such as Conceptual Captions and Visual Genome Dense Captions, all require non-trivial data collection and cleaning steps, limiting the size of datasets and thus hindering the scale of the trained models. In contrast, natural language processing (NLP) models have achieved SotA performance on GLUE and SuperGLUE benchmarks by utilizing large-scale pre-training on raw text without human labels. \nIn \"Scaling Up Visual and Vision-Language Representation Learning With Noisy Text Supervision\", to appear at ICML 2021, we propose bridging this gap with publicly available image alt-text data (written copy that appears in place of an image on a webpage if the image fails to load on a user's screen) in order to train larger, state-of-the-art vision and vision-language models. To that end, we leverage a noisy dataset of over one billion image and alt-text pairs, obtained without expensive filtering or post-processing steps in the Conceptual Captions dataset. We show that the scale of our corpus can make up for noisy data and leads to SotA representation, and achieves strong performance when transferred to classification tasks such as ImageNet and VTAB. The aligned visual and language representations also set new SotA results on Flickr30K and MS-COCO benchmarks, even when compared with more sophisticated cross-attention models, and enable zero-shot image classification and cross-modality search with complex text and text + image queries. \nCreating the Dataset\nAlt-texts usually provide a description of what the image is about, but the dataset is “noisy” because some text may be partly or wholly unrelated to its paired image. \n \n\nExample image-text pairs randomly sampled from the training dataset of ALIGN. One clearly noisy text label is marked in italics. \n\n    \nIn this work, we follow the methodology of constructing the Conceptual Captions dataset  to get a version of raw English alt-text data (image and alt-text pairs). While the Conceptual Captions dataset was cleaned by heavy filtering and post-processing, this work scales up visual and vision-language representation learning by relaxing most of the cleaning steps in the original work. Instead, we only apply minimal frequency-based filtering. The result is a much larger but noisier dataset of 1.8B image-text pairs. \nALIGN: A Large-scale ImaGe and Noisy-Text Embedding\nFor the purpose of building larger and more powerful models easily, we employ a simple dual-encoder architecture that learns to align visual and language representations of the image and text pairs. Image and text encoders are learned via a contrastive loss (formulated as normalized softmax) that pushes the embeddings of matched image-text pairs together while pushing those of non-matched image-text pairs (within the same batch) apart. The large-scale dataset makes it possible for us to scale up the model size to be as large as EfficientNet-L2 (image encoder) and BERT-large (text encoder) trained from scratch. The learned representation can be used for downstream visual and vision-language tasks. \n \n\nFigure of ImageNet credit to (Krizhevsky et al. 2012) and VTAB figure credit to (Zhai et al. 2019)\n\n The resulting representation can be used for vision-only or vision-language task transfer. Without any fine-tuning, ALIGN powers cross-modal search – image-to-text search, text-to-image search, and even search with joint image+text queries, examples below. \n \n\n\n\n   \nEvaluating Retrieval and Representation\nThe learned ALIGN model with BERT-Large and EfficientNet-L2 as text and image encoder backbones achieves SotA performance on multiple image-text retrieval tasks (Flickr30K and MS-COCO) in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings, as shown below.  \n   \n           Flickr30K (1K test set) R@1      MS-COCO (5K test set) R@1     \n  \n    Setting    Model       image → text             text → image             image → text             text → image         \n                                \n   Zero-shot       ImageBERT         70.7       54.3       44.0       32.3      \n  \n   UNITER      83.6        68.7       -       -      \n  \n   CLIP      88.0        68.7       58.4        37.8      \n  \n    ALIGN      88.6      75.7      58.6      45.6     \n      \n                                 \n    \n   Fine-tuned          GPO      88.7        76.1       68.1        52.7      \n  \n   UNITER      87.3        75.6       65.7        52.9      \n  \n   ERNIE-ViL      88.1       76.7       -       -      \n  \n   VILLA      87.9        76.3       -       -      \n  \n   Oscar      -       -       73.5       57.5      \n  \n    ALIGN      95.3      84.9      77.0      59.9     \n\n \nImage-text retrieval results (recall@1) on Flickr30K and MS-COCO datasets (both zero-shot and fine-tuned).

Such linear relationships between image and text embeddings also emerge in ALIGN. \nSpecifically, given a query image and a text string, we add their ALIGN embeddings together and use it to retrieve relevant images using cosine similarity, as shown below. These examples not only demonstrate the compositionality of ALIGN embeddings across vision and language domains, but also show the feasibility of searching with a multi-modal query. For instance, one could now look for the \"Australia\" or \"Madagascar\" equivalence of pandas, or turn a pair of black shoes into identically-looking beige shoes. Also, it is possible to remove objects/attributes from a scene by performing subtraction in the embedding space, shown below. \n \n\nImage retrieval with image text queries. By adding or subtracting text query embedding, ALIGN retrieves relevant images.\n\n Social Impact and Future Work\nWhile this work shows promising results from a methodology perspective with a simple data collection method, additional analysis of the data and the resulting model is necessary before the responsible use of the model in practice. For instance, considerations should be made towards the potential for the use of harmful text data in alt-texts to reinforce such harms. With regard to fairness, data balancing efforts may be required to prevent reinforcing stereotypes from the web data. Additional testing and training around sensitive religious or cultural items should be taken to understand and mitigate the impact from possibly mislabeled data. \nFurther analysis should also be taken to ensure that the demographic distribution of humans and related cultural items, such as clothing, food, and art, do not cause skewed model performance. Analysis and balancing would be required if such models will be used in production.  \nConclusion\nWe have presented a simple method of leveraging large-scale noisy image-text data to scale up visual and vision-language representation learning. The resulting model, ALIGN, is capable of cross-modal retrieval and significantly outperforms SotA models. In visual-only downstream tasks, ALIGN is also comparable to or outperforms SotA models trained with large-scale labeled data. \nAcknowledgement\nWe would like to thank our co-authors in Google Research: Ye Xia, Yi-Ting Chen, Zarana Parekh, Hieu Pham, Quoc V.

It&#8217;s not a good analysis, and in particular it gets the reality of European and Asian high-speed rail systems wrong. It displays lack of familiarity with rail practice and rail politics, to the point that most nontrivial assertions about rail in Europe and Asia are incorrect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More broadly, the way O&#8217;Toole gets rail investment here wrong comes from making unexamined American assumptions and substituting them for a European or Japanese reality regarding rail as well as rail politics. If the US can&#8217;t do it, he thinks other countries can&#8217;t. Unfortunately, he&#8217;s even unfamiliar with recent work done on American costs, when he compares the Interstate system positively with recent high-speed rail lines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>High-Speed Rail Profitability: France</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m currently working on building a database similar to <a href=\"https://transitcosts.com/\">our urban rail costs</a> for high-speed rail. Between this and previous iterations of analyzing the TGV, I&#8217;ve been reading a lot of internal French reports about its system. Thankfully, France makes available very good public information about the costs and technical specifications of its system. It helps that I read French, but the gap between what&#8217;s available for France and Belgium (see for example <a href=\"https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGV_Nord\">line</a> <a href=\"https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGV_1\">schemas</a>) is vast. This provides crucial background that O&#8217;Toole is missing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most important thing to understand is that the TGV network is profitable. The <a href=\"https://www.youscribe.com/BookReader/Index/2922391/?documentId=3224200\">Spinetta report on the fiscal losses of SNCF</a> makes it clear, starting on p. 60, that the TGV network is profitable, and recommends favoring its development over the money-losing legacy networks, especially the branch lines. The report even calls for closing weak branch lines with only a few trains a day, <a href=\"https://pedestrianobservations.com/2018/02/19/what-the-spinetta-axe-reveals-about-cost-control/\">which I called the Spinetta Axe at the time</a>, in analogy with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beeching_cuts\">Beeching Axe</a>. Due to public outcry the state rejected the cuts and only implemented the organizational changes promoted by the report.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, all lines are very profitable excluding the cost of fixed capital. The Spinetta report&#8217;s TGV section says that operating costs average €0.06/seat-km, which is around 0.085€/p-km, despite overstaffing of conductors (8 per conventional 400-car TGV) and extensive travel on legacy track at low speed and higher per-km labor costs. Average TGV fare revenue per <a href=\"https://www.autorite-transports.fr/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/ARAFER_Bilan-annuel-marche-ferroviaire-voyageurs-2015-2016.pdf\">an ARAFER report from 2016</a> is 0.10€/p-km &#8211; compare p-km on p. 15 and revenue on p. 26. This is typical for Europe &#8211; RENFE and DB charge similar fares, and the nominal fares seem to have been flat over the last decade.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What&#8217;s dicier is cost of capital. In all other European countries for which I&#8217;m aware of the process, all of which are Northern rather than Southern, this is done with benefit-cost analysis with a fixed behind-the-scenes discount rate. France, in my view wisely, rates lines by their financial and social rates of return instead. <a href=\"https://www.cade-environnement.org/files/2014/03/bilanrentabilitegpso.pdf\">A 2014 report</a> about the Bordeaux-Toulouse LGV, <a href=\"https://www.railwaygazette.com/high-speed/castex-agrees-to-fund-bordeaux-toulouse-high-speed-line/59032.article\">recently given the go-ahead</a> for <a href=\"https://www.toulouse-metropole.fr/-/lgv-toulouse-bordeaux\">7.5 billion €</a>, warns that the profitability of LGVs decreases as the system is built out: the LGV Sud-Est returned 15% to SNCF&#8217;s finances and 30% to French society (including rider consumer surplus), but subsequent lines only returned 4-7% to SNCF&#8217;s finances, and Bordeaux-Toulouse is likely to return less, 6% including social benefits per the study and at this point slightly less since the study assumed it would cost slightly less than the current budget.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The general theme in the French discourse on trains is that the TGV network is an obvious success. There absolutely is criticism, which focuses on the following issues:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><em>Regional</em> rail, that is not intercity rail, is underdeveloped in France outside Paris. The ridership of TER networks is pitiful in comparison with German-speaking and Nordic metropolitan areas of comparable size. For example, sourced to a dead link, <a href=\"https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/TER_Provence-Alpes-C%C3%B4te_d%27Azur#cite_note-Chiffres_TER-1\">Wikipedia claims</a> 64,300 TER PACA trips per day, comprising the metropolitan areas of Marseille (1.8 million), Nice (1), Toulon (0.6), and Avignon (0.5); in Helsinki (1.5) alone, <a href=\"https://raidepuolue.fi/uutiset//vr-listaa-vahvuutensa-lhijunakilpailutuksessa-tsmllisyys-turvallisuus-ja-tehokkuus\">there are 200,000 daily commuter rail trips</a>. But this isn&#8217;t really about high-speed rail, since TER planning and subsidies are devolved to regional governments, and not to SNCF.</li><li>SNCF has contentious labor relations. In the early 2010s, the unions went on a wave of strikes and got wage concessions that led to the evaporation of SNCF&#8217;s 600 million €/year primary surplus. The railway unions in France (&#8220;cheminots&#8221;) are unpopular, and Macron has been able to pass reforms to SNCF&#8217;s governance over their strikes and objections.</li><li><em>Future</em> LGVs are not as strong as past ones. Real costs in France are rising, and the network already links Paris with all major secondary cities in airplane-competitive time save Nice. Interprovincial links on the network are weak, despite the construction of the LGV Rhin-Rhône, and nothing like the Deutschlandtakt is on the horizon enabling everywhere-to-everywhere travel.</li><li>SNCF thinks like an airline and not like a railroad. It separates passengers into different buckets as airlines do, has many executives with airline background (and Spinetta is ex-Air France), thinks passengers do not ride trains for longer than 3 hours even though at 4 hours the modal split with air is still better than 50-50, and has poor integration between the TGV and legacy rail.</li><li>SNCF still has a lot of accumulated debt from past operating losses, some predating the TGV and the start of regional subsidies for regional rail. It was hoped that TGV profits could cover them, but they can&#8217;t. This mirrors the controversy in Japan in the 1980s, where, in the breakup of JNR into the JRs and their privatization, debt from past operating losses was wiped but not debt from Shinkansen construction (see <a href=\"http://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/761811468761126588/pdf/multi-page.pdf\">Privatization Best Practices</a>, PDF-p. 106).</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>However, saying that the <em>existing </em>network is a failure is the domain of cranks and populists. It is unrecognizable from the discussion of transportation investments in France.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What O&#8217;Toole says about high-speed rail</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>O&#8217;Toole&#8217;s understanding of internal French (or Spanish, or Japanese) issues is weak. This isn&#8217;t surprising &#8211; Americans to a good approximation <em>never</em> have good insights on the internal issues of any other country, even when it speaks English. The American political sphere, which includes political thinktanks like Cato, is remarkably ignorant globally, and rather incurious. As a result, what he says about the TGV is based on an Americanized understanding. To wit:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Bus-rail competition</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Northeastern United States has a weak rail network: Amtrak averages vintage 1960s speeds and charges 2-4 times the per-km fare of the TGV. As a result, an ecosystem of private intercity buses has developed, starting with unregulated ones like Fung Wah and, as they were shut down, corporate systems like Megabus and Bolt. O&#8217;Toole is fond of these buses, with their lower fares and road-like lack of integration between infrastructure and operations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And thus, he claims, falsely, that European high-speed rail cannibalized profitable buses. This is unrecognizable from within Europe, where intercity buses were underdeveloped until recently. In France, US-style intercity buses are called <em>Macron buses</em>, because the deregulation that brought them into existence passed in the mid-2010s, when Macron was the economy minister. They complement high-speed rail but do not replace it, because trains get me from Paris to the German border in 1:45 and buses don&#8217;t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be fair, TGV ridership has been stagnant in the last few years. But this stagnation goes back to the financial crisis, and if anything ridership picked up starting 2017 with the opening of the LGV Sud-Europe-Atlantique. So the buses are not even outcompeting the trains &#8211; they thrive in the gaps between them, just as historically they did on international routes, where rail fares are considerably higher and ridership lower.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>High-speed rail construction costs</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>O&#8217;Toole looks at the most expensive few lines possible:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Britain’s 345‐​mile London–Scotland HS2 high‐​speed rail line was originally projected to cost £32.7 billion (about $123 million per mile) and is currently expected to cost £106 billion ($400 million per mile).</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>International comparisons of high-speed rail costs exist, and Britain&#8217;s costs are by far the worst. For example, a <a href=\"https://www.australasiantransportresearchforum.org.au/sites/default/files/2013_henn_sloan.pdf\">2013 Australian comparison</a> looking at the prospects for such a system in Australia finds that High-Speed 1/CTRL, the line linking the Channel Tunnel with London, cost A$134 million/km, and the second costliest line in the dataset was thee 94% tunneled Bologna-Florence line, at A$95 million/km.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>French costs up until the LGV Bordeaux-Toulouse stood around $25-30 million per km in 2021 dollars, net of tunnels. German costs are similar, but German lines have far heavier tunneling than France, a range of 26-51% in tunnel compared with 0-6% in France. One reason is topography. But another is that Germany prefers mixed-use passenger-freight lines, which forces higher construction costs as freight requires gentler grades and, since superelevation must be lower, wider curves; France, like Japan and China, builds dedicated passenger lines, and, unlike Japan or China, keeps them largely at-grade to reduce costs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>O&#8217;Toole says, without more references, that it would cost $3-4 trillion to build a US-wide high-speed rail network. But the official Obama-era crayon, at 20,000 km, would be $500 billion at tunnel-free European costs, or maybe $600 billion with 5% tunneling, mostly in difficult places like California and across the Appalachians.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Freeway costs</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>O&#8217;Toole proposes more freeways, and says that to build the Interstate system today would cost $530 billion so it&#8217;s better than high-speed rail. Here is where his lack of knowledge of the most recent literature on infrastructure costs is a serious drag on his analysis: <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2019-07-12_infrastructure_costs_v2.pdf\">Brooks-Liscow establish that there was a large real increase in Interstate cost throughout the life of the program</a>, so a budget that&#8217;s really a mixture of cheaper early-1960s construction and more expensive construction in the 1970s is not applicable today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The same issue affects rail costs: the LGV Sud-Est cost, in today&#8217;s money, around $8 million/km, which cost would never recur. Brooks-Liscow explain this by greater surplus extraction from citizen voice groups, which demanded detours and route compromises raising costs. This appears true not just diachronically within the US but also synchronically across countries: so far, the low-cost subways we have investigated are all in states with bureaucratic rather than adversarial legalism, while medium-cost Germany is more mixed. Politicized demands leading to more tunneling are well-documented within Germany &#8211; the Berlin-Munich line was built through a topographically harder alignment in order to serve Erfurt, at Thuringia&#8217;s behest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So no, today costs from the 1960s are not relevant. Today, urban motorway extensions cost double-digit millions of dollars per lane-km, sometimes more. The I-5 improvement project in Los Angeles is $1.9 billion for <a href=\"http://my5la.com/i-5-south/\">I-5 South</a>, a distance of 11 km, <a href=\"https://metrolinktrains.com/i5/pdfs/i5/SO-BROCHURE_SEPTEMBER2013.pdf\">adding two lanes (one HOV, one mixed traffic)</a> in each direction. It&#8217;s possible to go lower than this &#8211; <a href=\"https://www.roadtraffic-technology.com/projects/m30_madrid/\">in Madrid this budget would buy a longer 6-lane tunnel</a> &#8211; but then in Madrid the construction costs of rail are even lower, for both metros and high-speed lines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The discourse on profits</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In contrast with the basic picture I outlined for the TGV, French media and researchers often point out threats to rail profitability. This can easily be taken to mean that the TGV is unprofitable, and if one has an American mindset, then it&#8217;s especially easy to think this. If SNCF officials say that 20% of TGVs lose money, then surely they must be hiding something and the figure is much higher, right? Likewise, if Spinetta says that the TGV network is profitable but not all trains are, then surely the situation is even worse, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But no. This is an Americanized interpretation of the debate. In the US, Amtrak is under constant pressure to show book profits, and its very existence is threatened, often by people who cite O&#8217;Toole and other libertarians. Thus, as a survival strategy, Amtrak pretends it is more profitable than it really is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This has no bearing on the behavior of railroads elsewhere, though. SNCF is not so threatened. The biggest threat from the perspective of SNCF management is union demands for higher wages, and therefore, its incentive is to cry poverty. Nobody in France takes out yardsticks of farebox recovery ratios, and therefore, nobody needs to orient their communications around what would satisfy American libertarians.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Energy</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Within the European high-speed rail research community, the energy efficiency of high-speed rail is well-understood, and many studies look at real-world examples, for example <a href=\"https://ietresearch.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1049/iet-est.2015.0002\">the metastudy of Hasegawa-Nicholson-Roberts-Schmid</a>. In fact, it&#8217;s understood that high-speed rail has lower energy consumption than conventional rail. For example, <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3141/2159-04\">here is García Álvarez&#8217;s paper on the subject</a>. This is counterintuitive, because higher speeds should surely lead to higher energy consumption, as Hasegawa et al demonstrate &#8211; but high-speed lines run at a uniform speed of 200 or 250 or 300 or 350 km/h, whereas legacy rail has many cycles of acceleration and deceleration. At speeds of up to about 200 km/h, nearly all electricity consumption is in acceleration and not maintaining constant speed, and even at 300 km/h, a late-model high-speed train consumes only above one third of its maximum power maintaining speed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of this literature, O&#8217;Toole picks out the fact that all else being equal energy consumption rises in speed, which it is not equal. Garcia in fact points out that higher speeds are better for the environment due to better competition with air, in line with environmental consensus that <a href=\"https://germanwatch.org/sites/default/files/Policy%20options%20to%20support%20a%20shift%20to%20rail.pdf\">trains are far superior on well-to-wheels emissions to cars</a> and planes. Worse, O&#8217;Toole is citing <a href=\"http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/5/1/014003\">Chester-Horvath&#8217;s lifecycle analysis</a>, which is not favorable to California High-Speed Rail&#8217;s energy efficiency. The only problem is that this paper&#8217;s analysis relies on a unit conversion error between BTUs and kWh, <a href=\"https://systemicfailure.wordpress.com/2012/04/26/carbon-footprint-of-a-high-speed-train/\">pointed out by Clem Tillier</a>. The paper was eventually corrected, and with the correct figures, high-speed rail looks healthy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Competition with cars and planes</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where high-speed rail exists, and the distance is within a well-understood range of around 300-800 km, it dominates travel. A <a href=\"http://test.ricerchetrasporti.it/wp-content/uploads/downloads/file_541.pdf\">2004 report by Steer Davies Gleave</a> has some profiles of what were then the world&#8217;s main networks. For Japan, it includes a graphic from 1998 on PDF-p. 120 of modal splits by distance. In the 500-700 km bucket, a slight majority of trips all over Japan are made by rail; this is because Tokyo-Osaka is within that range, and due to those cities&#8217; size this city pair dominates pairs where rail is weaker, especially inter-island ones. In the 300-500 km bucket more people drive, but the Shinkansen is stronger than this on the Tokyo-Nagoya pair, it&#8217;s just that 300-500 includes many more peripheral links with no high-speed rail service. It goes without saying that high-speed rail does not get any ridership where it does not exist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In France, <a href=\"https://www.lignenouvelle-provencecotedazur.fr/files/telechargements/medias/documents/lignenouvelle-synthese-socio-eco-janv13.pdf\">this was also studied for the LGV PACA</a>. On p. 14, the presentation lists modal splits as of 2009. Paris-Toulon, a city pair where the TGV takes around 4 hours, has an outright majority for the TGV, with 54% of the market, compared with 12% for air and 34% for driving. Paris-Cannes is 34% and Paris-Nice is 30%, both figures on the high side for their 5:00-5:30 train trips. Lyon-Nice, a 3:30 trip with awful frequency thanks to SNCF&#8217;s poor interprovincial service, still has a 25% market share for the TGV.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In general, competition with cars is understudied. Competition with planes is much more prominent in the literature, with plenty of reports on air-rail modal splits by train trip length. <a href=\"https://www.jreast.co.jp/investor/factsheet/pdf/factsheet_03.pdf\">JR East</a>, <a href=\"https://global.jr-central.co.jp/en/company/ir/annualreport/_pdf/annualreport2020.pdf\">Central</a> (PDF-p. 4), and <a href=\"https://www.westjr.co.jp/global/en/ir/library/fact-sheets/2020/pdf/fact08.pdf\">West</a> all report such market shares, omitting road transport. Many European analyses appeared in the 2000s, for example by Steer Davies Gleave again in 2006, but the links have rotted and <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/transport/modes/air/studies/internal_market_en\">Eurostat&#8217;s link</a> is corrupt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>O&#8217;Toole misunderstands this literature. He lumps all air and road links, even on markets where rail is weak, sometimes for geographical factors such as mountains or islands, sometimes for fixable institutional ones like European borders. In fact, at least measured in greenhouse gas emission and not ridership, <a href=\"https://www.transportenvironment.org/sites/te/files/publications/2020_03_Air2Rail_Koios_strategy_rev.pdf\">all air travel growth in Europe since 1990 has been international</a>. International high-speed rail exists in Europe but charges higher fares and the infrastructure for it is often not built, with slowdowns in border zones. This is a good argument for completing the international network in Europe and a terrible one against building any network at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Topography</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even at the level of basic topography, O&#8217;Toole makes elementary errors. He discusses the Tokaido Shinkansen, pointing out its factor-of-2 cost overrun. But its absolute costs were not high, which he characterizes as,</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>The Tokyo–Osaka high‐​speed rail line supposedly made money, but it was built across fairly flat territory</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>So, first of all, the &#8220;supposedly&#8221; bit is painful given how much JR Central prints money. But &#8220;fairly flat territory&#8221; is equally bad. Japan&#8217;s mountainous topography is not an obscure fact. It&#8217;s visible from satellite image. Per <a href=\"https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%9D%B1%E6%B5%B7%E9%81%93%E6%96%B0%E5%B9%B9%E7%B7%9A#%E8%B7%AF%E7%B7%9A%E3%83%87%E3%83%BC%E3%82%BF\">Japanese Wikipedia</a>, 13% of the route is in tunnel, more than California High-Speed Rail.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The United States can and should do better</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The report is on stronger grounds when criticizing specifics of Amtrak and California High-Speed Rail. American rail construction is just bad. However, this is not because rail is bad; it&#8217;s because the United States is bad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there&#8217;s the rub. Americans in politics can&#8217;t tell themselves that another country does something better than the US does. If it&#8217;s in other countries and the US can&#8217;t do it, it must be, as O&#8217;Toole calls rail, obsolete. This is especially endemic to libertarians, who are intellectually detached from their European right-liberal counterparts (Dutch VVD, German FDP, etc.) even more than the American center-left is from social democrats here and the right is from the mainline and extreme right here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So here, faced with not too hard to find evidence that high-speed rail is profitable in Europe and Asia, and in fact intercity rail is profitable here in general (direct subsidies are forbidden by EU law unless the line is classified as regional), unlike in the United States, O&#8217;Toole makes up reasons why trains here are unprofitable or unsuccessful. He says things that are not so much wrong as unrecognizable, regarding topography, buses, construction costs, debt, the state of the TGV debate, or greenhouse gas emissions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>O&#8217;Toole is aware of our transit costs comparison. I imagine he&#8217;s also aware of high-speed rail cost comparisons, which exist in the literature &#8211; if he&#8217;s not, it&#8217;s because he doesn&#8217;t want to be so aware. And yet, no matter how loudly the evidence screams &#8220;the United States needs to become more like France, Germany, Japan, Spain, etc.,&#8221; American libertarians always find excuses why this is bad or unnecessary. And then, when it comes to expanding freeways, suddenly the cost concerns go out the door and they use unrealistically low cost figures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But figuring out <em>why</em> the US is bad requires way deeper dives. It requires delving into the field and understanding how procurement is done differently, what is wrong with Amtrak, what is wrong with the California High-Speed Rail Authority, how engineering is done in low- and medium-cost countries, various tradeoffs for planning lead time, and so on. It requires turning into the kind of expert that libertarians have spent the last 60 years theorizing why they need not listen to (&#8220;public choice&#8221;). And it requires a lot of knowledge of internal affairs of successful examples, none of which is in an English-speaking country. So it&#8217;s easier to call this obsolete just because incurious Americans can&#8217;t do it.</p>\n","dc:creator":"Alon Levy","comments":"https://pedestrianobservations.com/2021/05/12/randal-otoole-gets-high-speed-rail-wrong/#comments","contentSnippet":"Now that there’s decent chance of US investment in rail, Randal O’Toole is resurrecting his takes from the early Obama era, warning that high-speed rail is a multi-trillion dollar money sink.

Before recent case surge in south Asia, we have seen <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/03/01/why-does-the-pandemic-seem-to-be-hitting-some-countries-harder-than-others\">stories</a> claiming that the pandemic might have hit some low-income countries less heavily than in the US or Europe, but many low-income countries were also lacking reliable official statistics such that the confirmed Covid-19 death counts might be questionable.  To figure out how mortality changed in rural Bangladesh in 2020, my collaborates conducted repeated phone surveys in 135 villages near Dhaka, and collected death counts from Jan 2019 to Oct 2020 (the survey questions include &#8220;Was member X in your household deceased during some time range Y? When? What reason?&#8221;).</p>\n<h5>The findings</h5>\n<p>The statistical analysis appears to be straightforward: compute the mortality rate in 2019 and 2020 in the sample, subtract, obtain their difference, run a t-test, done: You don&#8217;t need a statistician. Well, not really. Some deaths were duplicately reported from multiple families, which needs preprocessing and manual inspection; the survey population dynamically changed overtime because of possible migration, newborns, deaths, and survey drop-out, so we need some survival analysis; The survey has large sample size but we also want to stratify across demographical features such as age, gender and education;  The repeated survey is not random so we need to worry about selection bias from non-response and drop-out.</p>\n<p>It is interesting to compare these data to the <a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2012/06/12/simple-graph-win-the-example-of-birthday-frequencies/\">birthday model</a> on the day-of-month-effect effect.

For interpretation, we cannot apply the &#8220;divide-by-four&#8221; rule as the monthly death rate is low. But because of this low rate, log odds  is close to log probability hence we can directly take exponential of a small coefficient and treat that as a multiplicative factor, which further is approximated by exp(a)-1=a. Hence a logistics coefficient of 0.1 is approximately 10% multiplicatively increase in monthly death probability (it is like &#8220;divide-by-one&#8221;,  except the genuine divide-by-four rule is on the additive probability scale).</p>\n<p>One extra modeling piece is that we want to understand the excess mortality in finer granularity. So I also model this extra risk after Feb 2020 by another multilevel regression across age, gender and education. The following graph shows the excess mortality rate by age in females and from low-education families:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-08-at-9.54.49-PM.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-45585\" src=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-08-at-9.54.49-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"252\" height=\"162\" srcset=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-08-at-9.54.49-PM.png 616w, https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-08-at-9.54.49-PM-300x193.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 252px) 100vw, 252px\" /></a></p>\n<p>This type of modeling is natural or even<a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2021/04/19/hierarchical-modeling-of-excess-mortality-time-series/\"> default to anyone familiar with this blog</a>. Yet what I want to discuss is two additional challenges in communication.</p>\n<h5>How do we communicate excess mortality?</h5>\n<p>The figure above shows the excess mortality in terms of log odds, which in this context is close to log probability. We may want to aggregate this log odds into monthly death probability. That is done by the post-stratification step: we simulate the before and after monthly death probability for all cells, and aggregate them by 2019 census weights (in accordance to age, gender and education) in the same area. Below is the resulted excess mortality, where the unit is death count per month,</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-19-at-5.44.19-PM.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-45642\" src=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-19-at-5.44.19-PM-1024x671.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"253\" height=\"166\" srcset=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-19-at-5.44.19-PM-1024x671.png 1024w, https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-19-at-5.44.19-PM-300x197.png 300w, https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-19-at-5.44.19-PM-768x503.png 768w, https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-19-at-5.44.19-PM.png 1416w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 253px) 100vw, 253px\" /></a></p>\n<p>We actually see a decline in mortality starting from Feb 2020, especially for high ages (80 and above), likely due to extra cautions or family companions. Because of their high baseline values, this high age group largely dominates the overall mortality comparison. Indeed we estimate a negative overall excess mortality in this area since Feb 2020.  On the other hand, if we look into the average log odds change, the estimate is less constrained and largely overlaps with zero.</p>\n<p>We report both results in a transparent way. You can play with <a href=\"https://github.com/yao-yl/mortalityPaper\">our Stan code and data</a> too. But my point here is more about how we communicate &#8220;excess mortality&#8221;. Think about an artificial make-up example: <span class=\"\">Say there are three age group, children, adults (age</span><span class=\"\"> &lt;59.5</span><span class=\"\">), elderly adults (age &gt;59.5). S</span><span class=\"\">uppose</span><span class=\"\"> they have a baseline mortality rate (0.5, 5, 30) per year per thousand people, and also assume the census proportion of these three age groups is (20%, 60%, 20%). </span><span class=\"\">If their mortality changes by -10%, -10%, 20%, the average percentage change is -4%.  </span>But the absolute mortality change from (0.5, 5, 30) * (20%, 60%, 20%)=9.1 to<span class=\"\"> 9.99, which is 0.89 excess death per year per thousand people, or a 0.89/9.1=10% </span><span class=\"\" style=\"font-family: Helvetica, arial, sans-serif;\"> </span><span class=\"\">increase. </span> Is it a 10% increase, or a 4% decrease? That all depends on your interpretation. I don&#8217;t want to call it a Simpson&#8217;s paradox. Here both numbers are meaningful on its own: the average excess log <span class=\"\">mortality</span> measures the average individual risk change;  the average excess <span class=\"\">mortality</span> is related to death tolls. I think WHO and CDC report the latter number, but it also has the limitation of being driven by only one subgroup—we have discussed similar math problems in the context of <a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2020/09/02/path-sampling-in-stan/\">simulated tempering and thermodynamics</a>, and a similar story in<a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2021/04/25/is-it-really-true-that-the-u-s-death-rate-in-2020-was-the-highest-above-normal-since-the-early-1900s-even-surpassing-the-calamity-of-the-1918-flu-pandemic/\"> age-adjustment over time.</a></p>\n<h5>The excess morality depends on the what comparison window to pick</h5>\n<p>Lastly,  the question we would like to address from the evidence of &#8220;excess morality&#8221; is essentially a causal question: what we care is the difference in death tolls if covid had not occurred hypothetically.  Except this causal question is even harder: we do not know when covid was likely to be a significant factor in this area. In other words, the treatment label is unobserved.</p>\n<p>Instead of doing a change-point-detection, which I think would lead to non-indetfication if I would model the individual treatment effect,  I view the starting month of the excess morality comparison window as part of the causal assumption.  I fit the model with varying assumption and compute the excess mortality rate starting from Feb to Aug.   The results are interesting: the overall excess mortality is nearly negative when we compare  2020 and 2019, which is the result we report in the title. But if we choose a only compare later months, such as starting from July, there is a gradually positive excess mortality, especially for people in the age group 50–79. Well, it is not significant, and we need multiple testing when we vary these assumptions, but I don&#8217;t think a hypothesis testing is relevant here. Overall, this increasing trend is concerning, amid a more serious third wave recently in South Asia at large.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-2.46.16-PM.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-45704\" src=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-2.46.16-PM-1024x304.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"617\" height=\"183\" srcset=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-2.46.16-PM-1024x304.png 1024w, https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-2.46.16-PM-300x89.png 300w, https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-2.46.16-PM-768x228.png 768w, https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-2.46.16-PM.png 1482w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 617px) 100vw, 617px\" /></a></p>\n<p>We also report the relative changes (there is always a degree of freedom to choose between multiplicative and additive effect in causal inference).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-2.46.21-PM.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-45705\" src=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-2.46.21-PM-1024x303.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"619\" height=\"183\" srcset=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-2.46.21-PM-1024x303.png 1024w, https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-2.46.21-PM-300x89.png 300w, https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-2.46.21-PM-768x227.png 768w, https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-2.46.21-PM.png 1472w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 619px) 100vw, 619px\" /></a></p>\n<p>This type of varying-causal-assumption-as-much-as-you-can is what we recommend in workflow: when we have multiple plausible causal assumptions, report fits from all models (Fig 22 of the<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.01808.pdf\"> workflow paper</a>).</p>\n<p>But this graph leads to further questions. Recall the birthday model: if the there are fewer newborns in Halloween, then there have to be more on the days before or after. The same baby-has-to-go-somewhere logic applies here. Despite the overall excess mortality was likely negative starting from Feb 2020, we infer there was an increasing trend of mortality since the second half of 2020, especially for the age group 50–79. What we do not know for sure is whether, this positive excess mortality was a real temporal effect (a signal of gradual Covid infections), or a compensation for fewer deaths in the first half the year. Likewise, in many counties where there was a strong positive excess mortality in 2020, there could as well be a mortality decline in the following short term.  In the latter case, is this base-population change from the previous period (aka &#8220;dry tinder effect&#8221;, or the opposite wet tinder) part of the indirect effect, or mediation, of Covid-19? Or is it the confounder that we want to adjust for by fixing a constant population? The answer depends on how the &#8220;treatment&#8221; is defined, as akin to the ambiguity of a &#8220;race effect&#8221; in social science study.</p>\n","dc:creator":"Yuling Yao","comments":"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2021/05/12/we-use-mrp-to-estimate-excess-mortality-rate/#respond","contentSnippet":"(This post is by Yuling, not by/reviewed by Andrew) Recently I (Yuling) have contributed to a public heath project with many great collaborates: The goal is to understand the excess mortality in potential relevance to Covid-19.

It takes so much more evidence to correct a mistaken claim than to establish it in the first place.</p>\n<p>I still suspect there is an additional factor: the implicit goal of much of the public health apparatus to serve the health care delivery system.  One reason mask use was discouraged at the beginning of the pandemic was to protect the supply of N-95s to health care practitioners.  Travel bans were opposed, since international travel and the movement of supplies were regarded as necessary for organizing and administering care, especially in developing countries.  Recognition of aerosol transmission would have required the costly air filtration systems used in infectious disease wards to be installed throughout all hospitals and clinics (at least, as I understand it, under current protocols).  This also helps explain the prominence given to hospitalization and ICU use as morbidity metrics, and the delayed recognition of long Covid as a health concern in its own right.  If the primary constituency, and source of funding and personnel, for the public health apparatus is the medical system, it makes sense that, under conditions of uncertainty, the needs of medical practitioners would take precedence over those of the public at large.  You can always justify it by saying we need the hospitals to be well stocked, doctors to travel freely, demand to be well below capacity and operations to not be bogged down by complicated protocols so the public can be better served.  This is also relevant to the blog because there has been a sort of slipperiness about what outcomes constitute the costs and benefits that go into decision making under uncertainty.</p>\n<p>The pandemic has been a spectacular laboratory for exploring the interconnections between science, the rules of evidence, risk communication, institutional incentives and political pressures.  Some probing books about this will probably appear over the coming years.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Interesting points.  I hadn&#8217;t thought of it that way, but it makes sense.

WALENSKY: &#8230; There’s increasing data that suggests that most of transmission is happening indoors rather than outdoors; less than 10 percent of documented transmission, in many studies, have occurred outdoors.&#8221;  Less than 10%&#8230;as Leonhardt points out, that is true but extremely misleading. Leonardt says &#8220;That benchmark &#8216;seems to be a huge exaggeration,&#8217; as Dr. Muge Cevik, a virologist at the University of St. Andrews, said. In truth, the share of transmission that has occurred outdoors seems to be below 1 percent and <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" title=\"\" href=\"https://twitter.com/MonicaGandhi9/status/1390164552101240836\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">may be below 0.1 percent</a>, multiple epidemiologists told me.

With the running shoes, the ad was trying to make Reeboks seem as performance-boosting as possible, but what was the CDC trying to do? Once they decided to give a number that is almost completely divorced from the data, why not go all the way? They could say &#8220;less than 30% of the documented transmissions have occurred outdoors&#8221;, or &#8220;less than 50%&#8221;, or anything they want&#8230;it&#8217;s all true! </p>\n","dc:creator":"Phil","comments":"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2021/05/11/if-a-value-is-less-than-10-you-can-bet-its-not-0-1-usually/#comments","contentSnippet":"This post is by Phil Price, not Andrew.

I like the whole shark repellent thing, as it connects to the whole “shark attacks determine elections” story. Also, Jeff points out that “a Julia win would open at least the possibility of a Wilde-Child semifinal,” and Diana brings up the tantalizing possibility that Julia Grownup would show up. That would be cool. I looked up Julia Grownup and it turns out she was on Second City too!</p>\n<p>As for today’s noontime matchup . . . What can I say? New Jersey’s an amazing place. Hoboken’s own Frank Sinatra is only the #3 seed of our entries from that state, and he’s pitted against Virginia Apgar, an unseeded Jerseyite. Who do you want to invite for our seminar: the Chairman of the Board, or a pioneering doctor who’s a familiar name to all parents of newborns?</p>\n<p>Here’s an intriguing twist: I looked up Apgar on wikipedia and learned that she came from a musical family!

There hasn&#8217;t been a lot of space to do that because of, well, shit like this:</p><div class=\"tweet\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/TomBrady/status/1391553067498287106?s=20&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;Hmmmm should I change it?? &quot;,&quot;username&quot;:&quot;TomBrady&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Tom Brady&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;Mon May 10 00:37:59 +0000 2021&quot;,&quot;photos&quot;:[],&quot;quoted_tweet&quot;:{&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;Rumor has it @TomBrady is loading up on Bitcoin.\\n\\nRetweet if you think the GOAT should turn on laser eyes.\\n\\nLet&#8217;s make it happen. https://t.co/opPjtBGwAD&quot;,&quot;username&quot;:&quot;JasonYanowitz&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Yano&quot;},&quot;retweet_count&quot;:4822,&quot;like_count&quot;:46512,&quot;expanded_url&quot;:{}}\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/TomBrady/status/1391553067498287106?s=20\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"tweet-header\"><img class=\"tweet-user-avatar\" src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/twitter_name/w_36/TomBrady.jpg\" alt=\"Twitter avatar for @TomBrady\"><span class=\"tweet-author-name\">Tom Brady </span><span class=\"tweet-author\">@TomBrady</span></div>Hmmmm should I change it?? <div class=\"quoted-tweet\"><p><span class=\"quote-tweet-name\">Yano </span><span class=\"quote-tweet-username\">@JasonYanowitz</span></p>Rumor has it @TomBrady is loading up on Bitcoin.\n\nRetweet if you think the GOAT should turn on laser eyes.\n\nLet&#8217;s make it happen. https://t.co/opPjtBGwAD</div><div class=\"tweet-footer\"><p class=\"tweet-date\">May 10th 2021</p><span class=\"retweets\"><span class=\"rt-count\">4,822</span> Retweets</span><span class=\"likes\"><span class=\"like-count\">46,512</span> Likes</span></div></a></div><p>I don&#8217;t really have a lot to say about Tom Brady&#8217;s laser eyes other than the fact that precious brain space was vaporized this week logging on and being force fed tweets from crypto dudes with laser eye Twitter avatars getting very excited about Tom Brady&#8217;s laser eyes. </p><p>Similarly, I&#8217;ve tried to spend some time understanding NFTs (I wrote about them here for the NYT) but I usually get <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/01/style/zed-run-horse-racing.html\">derailed by storylines like this</a> featuring people buying digital horses for hundreds of thousands of dollars: </p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 image2-820-1456\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2f43358a-faae-42d0-b21e-6ebf574a49df_1514x853.png\"><img src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2f43358a-faae-42d0-b21e-6ebf574a49df_1514x853.png\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2f43358a-faae-42d0-b21e-6ebf574a49df_1514x853.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:820,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:969275,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}\" alt=\"\"><style>\n          a.image2.image-link.image2-820-1456 {\n            padding-bottom: 56.31868131868132%;\n            padding-bottom: min(56.31868131868132%, 820px);\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 0;\n          }\n          a.image2.image-link.image2-820-1456 img {\n            max-width: 1456px;\n            max-height: 820px;\n          }\n        </style></a></figure></div><p>Then, of course, there&#8217;s Dogecoin, the cryptocurrency created as a parody and critique of Bitcoin that has been winkingly championed by billionaire and recent <em>SNL</em> host Elon Musk and is now worth a lot of actual money (so much so that apparently Goldman Sachs managing directors are making enough off it to <a href=\"https://www.efinancialcareers.com/news/2021/05/goldman-sachs-london-md-dogecoin\">quit their jobs</a>).

It is selling for a very specific six-figure sum that is a combination of the numbers 69 (hehe sex!) and 420 (blaze it!). Similarly, it seems that Dogecoiners tried their damnedest to drive Dogecoin to 69 cents a coin by the start of Musk&#8217;s SNL monologue.

I&#8217;m thinking about the way that groups of people who are good at harnessing attention are giddily, proudly using that power to drag absurdist memes/currencies/fortunes into mainstream discourse and force the rest of us to care about/debate/or at least know about it all. Personally, it scrambles my brain. </p><p>Merely engaging with an NFT of a well-hung cartoon Elon Musk or writing about a meme coin feels like falling for a not-so-elaborate troll by a bunch of bored message board teens. The non-lizard portion of my brain tells me to dismiss it or sneer at it. But I&#8217;m not sure I can do that because the crypto stuff is also ostensibly something that is, in some way, real. There&#8217;s money behind it, which means there are real stakes to all this, including, <a href=\"https://deezlinks.substack.com/p/so-can-we-make-nfts-work-for-black\">as Delia Cai pointed out</a> today, who is left out. I don&#8217;t have to like it or think it&#8217;s the future of <em>anything, </em>but I&#8217;ve spent enough time covering the internet to be reflexively anxious about wholly dismissing things just because they&#8217;re stupid. And so here I am.</p><p>I don&#8217;t think anyone has captured this palms-to-the sky shrugging feeling better than <em>Bloomberg&#8217;s</em> Matt Levine did in <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-05-06/dogecoin-is-up-because-it-s-funny?sref=B3uFyqJT\">his Thursday newsletter</a> (I bolded the bit that&#8217;s been stuck in my brain): </p><blockquote><p>Just imagine traveling 10 years back in time and trying to explain&nbsp;this to someone; just imagine what an idiot you&#8217;d feel like. &#8220;There&#8217;s going to be this online currency that people think is a form of digital gold, and then there&#8217;s going to be a&nbsp;<em>different</em>&nbsp;online currency that is a parody of the first one based on a meme about a talking Shiba Inu, and that one will have a market capitalization bigger than 80% of the companies in the S&amp;P 500, and its value will&nbsp;fluctuate based on things like who is hosting &#8216;Saturday Night Live&#8217; and whether people tweet a hashtag about it on the pot-joke holiday, and Bloomberg will write articles and banks will write research notes about those sorts of catalysts, and it will remain a perfectly&nbsp;ridiculous content-free parody even as people properly take it completely seriously because there are billions of dollars at stake.&#8221;</p><p><strong>For that matter, imagine being me, now, and trying to say something interesting about this; just imagine what an idiot I feel like.</strong>&nbsp;I hope Elon Musk is funny on SNL! That will make the value of Dogecoin go up! Me, I want to write about&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-05-04/under-armour-earnings-were-a-bit-misleading?sref=1kJVNqnU\">dynamic&nbsp;hedging of inverse exchange-traded notes on volatility indexes</a>, but that&#8217;s not how finance works anymore. &#8220;Don't forget to pencil in the SNL opening as a key market event risk for next week,&#8221;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/tracyalloway/status/1390112973587316739\">tweeted Bloomberg&#8217;s Tracy Alloway</a>.</p></blockquote><p>What is happening is ridiculous! It is also <em>actually </em>happening and so we are forced to engage with it. By doing so, we, too, feel ridiculous.</p><p>Levine&#8217;s great skill is viewing current events with equal measures of detachment and omniscience &#8212; like an alien with a background in finance bemusedly studying Earthling behavior. And one of his primary insights is that the specific collision of forces (a volatile, algorithmically powered attention economy, internet culture, a volatile, algorithmically powered financial system, deepening inequality and resentment, trolling billionaires) injects true absurdity into industries that traditionally take themselves quite seriously. </p><p>Take <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-27/reddit-driven-surge-puts-gamestop-and-ryan-cohen-in-a-weird-spot?sref=B3uFyqJT\">this bit on what</a> it must have been like to be GameStop&#8217;s CEO during the January r/WallStreetBets&nbsp;stock run:</p><blockquote><p>You know who has a weird job right now? George Sherman. GameStop&#8217;s executives and board of directors don&#8217;t seem to have said much recently. What could they say? &#8220;Huh, nice that the stock&#8217;s up.&#8221; One important thing to remember is that while you and I and Reddit and Elon Musk can all treat GameStop&#8217;s stock as an absurd gambling token, a toy adrift on market sentiment far from any economic reality, it&nbsp;<em>is&nbsp;</em>still the stock of a company. The company&#8217;s executives still come to work each day and have to figure out what this all means.&nbsp; </p></blockquote><p>And then another Levine <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-27/reddit-driven-surge-puts-gamestop-and-ryan-cohen-in-a-weird-spot?sref=B3uFyqJT\">confession </a>(emphasis mine):</p><blockquote><p><strong>I don&#8217;t know, I feel like a moron typing all of this. But I just have to type it! </strong>Think of how GameStop&#8217;s board must feel! The market is telling them something, but it is hard to hear what it&#8217;s saying through its maniacal laughter.  </p></blockquote><p>As somebody who has written about the internet professionally for over a decade, I feel that bolded sentence in the marrow of my bones. I felt something similar the first time I wrote a serious news story that had occasion to site a Reddit user with a name like AnimeDiaperBaby69. I felt it when I had to explain the Pepe meme for the first time on an <em>NPR </em>appearance and when I was alerted to the honor that I was the first person to use the word &#8216;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/06/opinion/internet-meme-joe-biden-trump.html\">memesmith</a>&#8217; in the pages of the <em>New York Times. </em></p><p>It&#8217;s a peculiar feeling &#8212; you want to apologize a little but also, you&#8217;re really hoping people will not dismiss you outright. You regret to inform your readers that you&#8217;ve wrestled the pig and you&#8217;re covered in shit and you&#8217;ve done it so many times that you&#8217;re starting to wonder if maybe you&#8217;re just a professional pig wrestler now (but hey, somebody has to catch the pigs, right?).</p><p>In other words, you feel absurd. But, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/10/the-cruelty-is-the-point/572104/\">to borrow a phrase</a>, the absurdity is the point. I&#8217;ve <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/14/opinion/trump-shooting-video.html\">written about how absurdity</a> and irony in both MAGA internet and even darker, white nationalist circles has a certain utility: Giving cover/plausible deniability to its creators and fellow sharers. &#8220;To engage at all is, in some way, to lose; no matter how righteous and warranted your outrage is, you&#8217;re pulled down to their level,&#8221; <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/14/opinion/trump-shooting-video.html\">I wrote</a><strong><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/14/opinion/trump-shooting-video.html\"> </a></strong><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/14/opinion/trump-shooting-video.html\">back in 2019</a> when an incredibly stupid and violent pro-Trump meme was shown at a GOP conference in a &#8216;hall of memes&#8217; exhibit. </p><p>I still mostly believe that. But the plausible deniability element or even the fact that the video would &#8216;trigger&#8217; the mainstream media seems less relevant than the pure absurdity. Take that 2019 hall of memes example: The clip was an edited version hyperviolent scene from the film <em>Kingsman: The Secret Service,</em> in which President Trump&#8217;s face is superimposed on the film&#8217;s protagonist<strong> </strong>while he murders people in a church; his victims&#8217; faces have been replaced with the faces of&nbsp;politicians, journalists, entertainers and the logos of media organizations. Then, the fake president shoots a person whose face has been replaced by the Black Lives Matter logo. </p><p>It&#8217;s profoundly fucked up, but it&#8217;s also the exact sort of thing that a bunch of over-caffeinated teens might make. It&#8217;s not a particularly well-made meme &#8212; it&#8217;s proudly lo-fi and shitty. And yet its mere existence was front page news! The story was broken by two of the <em>New York Times&#8217; </em>most senior political reporters! I don&#8217;t mean this as media criticism &#8212; I&#8217;m just stating this as a fact. Some bigoted jabronis made something very dumb and<a href=\"https://lifehacker.com/how-to-recognize-a-shitpost-on-social-media-1846282264\"> shitposted</a> their way into the paper of record (and then I wrote about it in that same paper!) </p><p>For about twelve hours, the video was the biggest story in political media, with every commentator and reporter forced to acknowledge its absurdity &#8212; but likewise forced to talk about it with grave, somber language. That most of the media felt both exasperated and outraged by the video&#8217;s existence, with no choice other than to talk about it &#8212;&nbsp;that was the desired outcome. The gatekeepers had been directed by their assignment editors, the shitposters. The absurdity is where the real power lies.<strong> </strong>Specifically, I mean the ability to force that absurdity onto others &#8212; to drag everyone into your inside jokes/insults/culture and force them to care.</p><p>Maybe this is just blindingly obvious and has always been &#8212; but it feels like a dominant dynamic in our culture right now. It&#8217;s present in the crypto stuff and in the GameStop saga and in our politics: the most visible Republican politicians these days aren&#8217;t, in truth, actual legislators as much as professional shitposters. Smart people like my former colleague Kevin Roose have argued that this is part of a larger <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/28/technology/gamestop-stock.html\">authority crisis</a>. Citing the writer Martin Gurri, Roose <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/28/technology/gamestop-stock.html\">described </a>the GameStop dynamic as &#8220;a kind of vengeful nihilism, an urge to burn down the establishment without a clear sense of what&#8217;s supposed to replace it.&#8221;</p><p>I agree with this argument to a degree. But there might be <em>even less</em> to it. While I&#8217;m sure plenty want to burn down the establishment, I&#8217;d argue that the absurdity is a good old fashioned act of protest. In the finance examples, it seems a clear cut example of a bunch of frustrated people trying to get across a simple message: <em>The hyper-financialized world you&#8217;ve all created is absurd and tragic and dystopian. The only people insulated from it are those that create and benefit from it. But now we&#8217;re going to force you to reckon with some absurdity, too.</em></p><p>And so the CEO of GameStop, who is mostly just collateral damage, has to show up and try to figure out what the fuck &#8220;dumbledoreRothIRA&#8217;s&#8221; last Reddit post might do to the stock price. Long insulated from having to care about the hordes or the meme-ified dynamics of their lives, hedge fund managers are now forced to live in the shitposters&#8217; world. <em>Oh, you think meme stocks are absurd and dystopian? Try working 4 app-based gig-economy jobs to pay the bills!</em></p><p>I&#8217;m not sure this networked and weaponized absurdity is the product of &#8220;vengeful nihilism&#8221; because I&#8217;m not sure the message is that &#8216;lol nothing matters.&#8217; To me, the message is similar to that of any protest: <em>We</em> matter. And you&#8217;re going to listen to us. And the way they show that is by leveraging absurdity programming the conversation. And, if, as Gurri suggests, there&#8217;s no clear sense of what should replace the status quo, it&#8217;s because that might not be the point. Making the status quo confused and uncomfortable is the point. The absurdity is the point. </p><p>I&#8217;m not sure any of this is de facto good or bad (Though I am not heartened that the people who seem to do this well and whose antics are largely tolerated are a familiar type of internet-obsessed and frequently white dudes). Hell, I&#8217;m not sure if any of this is even new &#8212; the only thing that is definitely new is the speed and ease with which large groups can harness attention and, ultimately power. Like I said earlier, it all scrambles my brain and exhausts me. That might very well be the point! The only thing I feel confident in saying is that our politics and our culture and our discourse will continue to get more absurd until morale improves.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 image2-220-1100\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48e43f00-7986-4f3b-bb3f-0ec9cb3f4746_1100x220.png\"><img src=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48e43f00-7986-4f3b-bb3f-0ec9cb3f4746_1100x220.png\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/48e43f00-7986-4f3b-bb3f-0ec9cb3f4746_1100x220.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:220,&quot;width&quot;:1100,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:207052,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}\" alt=\"\"><style>\n          a.image2.image-link.image2-220-1100 {\n            padding-bottom: 20%;\n            padding-bottom: min(20%, 220px);\n            width: 100%;\n            height: 0;\n          }\n          a.image2.image-link.image2-220-1100 img {\n            max-width: 1100px;\n            max-height: 220px;\n          }\n        </style></a></figure></div><p>Ok!

I&#8217;ve been unable to entirely get over my COVID-inspired lassitude.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">For nearly a year I didn&#8217;t do much.  I stayed in my house and left only on important errands, like visiting the supermarket and the pharmacy and the karate school.  (Kenpo is my Necessary Sanity Thing.  It kept me from boiling over.  The school was socially distanced and we all wore masks, but still it was riskier than I would have liked.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">When Kathy had to fly East for four months over the winter, I settled into the hermit life.  I&#8217;d get up in the morning, have my coffee and a piece of fruit, and maybe watch some Netflix.  At some point I&#8217;d do some form of exercise, often while watching more Netflix.  Then I&#8217;d write late into the night.  I missed no deadlines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Though I could write, I couldn&#8217;t read for some reason. My mind was too scattered to stay on the page.  When the opportunity arose to nominate for this year&#8217;s awards, I looked through my files and realized I&#8217;d read only one book published in 2020, and though my Kindle told me I&#8217;d read it, I didn&#8217;t remember it at all.  And this was by a writer I like!</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Cooking and cleaning and necessary repairs got done.  Nothing more than that, though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">When Kathy came back, I had to make some adjustments.  I was used to spending my mornings with my coffee and my fruit and my video, and here was this whole other person in the house who wanted to <em>talk</em> to me for some reason!  It took me a while to get used to the idea that I was supposed to talk <em>back</em>.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">And now my horizon has broadened right out, and I&#8217;m going out to see people and do stuff, and I&#8217;ve got to do yard work and ride my tractor and arrange for more necessary repairs.  But it&#8217;s more difficult than it was, and takes more effort.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Mind you, once I get there, once I see my friends and have some drinks and share a fine meal, I have a good time, and the good time is effortless and joyful.  It&#8217;s just making the arrangements and <em>getting there</em> that seems to take more dedication than it used to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">I wish I had a conclusion for this little essay, full of wit and insight, but I seem to lack the energy.</p>\n","dc:creator":"wjw","comments":"http://www.walterjonwilliams.net/2021/05/lassitude/#respond","contentSnippet":"The horizon has grown wider and brighter since I had my COVID shots, with my life regaining some of its former zest, with meetings and meals with friends, and more opportunities for social interaction that don’t involve Zoom calls and social media.
